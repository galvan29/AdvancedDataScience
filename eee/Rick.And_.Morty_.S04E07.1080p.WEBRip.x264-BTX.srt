1
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:17,927
Aah, aah!

2
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:25,201
Oh, my god.

3
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:26,522
Holy oh.

4
00:00:26,546 --> 00:00:27,855
<i>What are...
What are these things?!</i>

5
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:28,938
Do I look like I know?

6
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:31,066
Last thing I remember, I was,
ugh, in a cave.

7
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,276
<i>Looking at some wet egg and...
Oh, that probably did it.</i>

8
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,610
I told you not to look
at that egg!

9
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:35,945
I-it was too wet.

10
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,280
You don't get to tell me
what to look at.

11
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:38,548
I've seen your pornhub account.

12
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:40,149
Also, who makes
a pornhub account?

13
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:42,351
The algorithm learns your
preferences better that way.

14
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,354
Plus if you get in kind
of a cool enough relationship,

15
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,955
You can sort
of follow each other.

16
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,423
And check out
each other's kinks, you know?

17
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:48,897
Alright, god damn, sold.

18
00:00:48,921 --> 00:00:50,499
- How do we get out of here?
- Morty, relax.

19
00:00:50,523 --> 00:00:51,754
They're face-hugging parasites.

20
00:00:51,778 --> 00:00:54,473
I don't think their society's
gonna be that hard to navigate.

21
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:59,502
Okay, yeah, this might be
a little harder than I thought.

22
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:02,372
Holy
they've got an m&m's store.

23
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,674
<i>This is bad, Rick.
Th-th-th-th-this is really bad.</i>

24
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:40,009
Just be cool, Morty.

25
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,411
All we gotta do is blend in,
find our ship,

26
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,146
And get the outta here.

27
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,148
Alright, Morty, here's the plan,
put this back on your face.

28
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:48,017
I-I'm not putting that back
on my face! Relax. It's dead.

29
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,487
Okay, now it's dead.

30
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:54,424
Come on, hurry up.

31
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:55,425
Rick, I-it's bleeding.

32
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:56,623
I-it's bleeding acid.

33
00:01:56,647 --> 00:01:58,227
Alright, well, that should
be the last of it.

34
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:00,896
If not, then just gimme
two tugs on the arm.

35
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:06,302
Seems like a self-destructive
life cycle.

36
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:07,570
Is that gonna happen to us?

37
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:08,904
You feel an egg in your stomach?

38
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:11,841
- No.
- Well, glass half full.

39
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:13,242
<i>How's it going?
'Sup.</i>

40
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:14,444
- Glory to glorzo.
- Totally.

41
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:15,645
Love glorzo.

42
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:17,447
Glorzo is peace.

43
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:18,782
Peace is glorzo.

44
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:21,250
Wow, just cogs in the machine,
y'know?

45
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:23,119
- Ma-makes you think...
- Yeah, I'm sure you'll make this.

46
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,054
Into a beautiful short film
that your parents'll pay for,

47
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:26,990
Morty, but right now, we really
just need to find my ship.

48
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:28,792
You sure you're not
just jealous?

49
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:30,926
Looks like I'm kind of
a celebrity around here.

50
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,796
The future is glorzo!

51
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,599
<i>Oh, my god.
I was just reading you.</i>

52
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:38,334
Congratulations on making it
into print media.

53
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:39,735
Real bright future there.

54
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,605
Honestly, it's shocking to see
the two of you together.

55
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:43,607
Because we're both geniuses?

56
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:45,408
No, because I've seen
your videos,

57
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:47,210
And you make me sick.

58
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:49,330
Fix him.

59
00:02:51,136 --> 00:02:52,248
Glory to glorzo.

60
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,749
Sir, you shouldn't
wander off like that.

61
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,024
We've been looking
all over for you.

62
00:02:55,048 --> 00:02:56,686
The project is ready
for your approval.

63
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,421
Sir, is this man bothering you?

64
00:02:58,445 --> 00:02:59,823
Um, no, h-he's fine.

65
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,691
Uh, what... what project?

66
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:04,093
Jesus christ,
who the was I?

67
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:07,563
Here's a scientific fact
I'm not allowed to say...

68
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:11,967
Our hosts are biologically
designed to incubate our eggs.

69
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:14,170
If that "triggers" you,
off.

70
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,839
If it doesn't,
please like and subscribe.

71
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:17,841
New videos every glorzday.

72
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,308
God,
was I at least rich?

73
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,977
I mean, d-d-did
I at least sell out.

74
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:22,378
And sell vitamins or something?

75
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:23,980
Rick, I've watched enough
pornhub to know.

76
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:25,581
What a studio apartment
looks like.

77
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,050
God damn.

78
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:29,585
Jesus, your glorzo got
done.

79
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:32,388
My lord,
we await your command.

80
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:33,523
Oh, to...

81
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,258
<i>Shoot it?
A-at people?</i>

82
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:36,592
Glorzo is peace.

83
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,261
All shall be made glorzo.

84
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:40,396
Glory to glorzo.

85
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,797
I... Did this?

86
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:45,401
You and the amazing technology
you both brought us.

87
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:46,802
Yeah, makes sense.

88
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:47,937
A-and where was this heading?

89
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:48,938
<i>Earth?
Probably earth?</i>

90
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,806
The humans call it "earth."

91
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,008
Yeah, well, okay,
first of all, great work.

92
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:54,810
You guys obviously put a lot
of work into this.

93
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:56,546
<i>Okay.
And y'know, it shows.</i>

94
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,481
<i>I-it really shows.
But um...</i>

95
00:03:58,505 --> 00:03:59,949
I-I've been thinking,
and, you know,

96
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:02,018
Maybe we should
just call this off.

97
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:03,687
Sorry, is... is there more?

98
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:04,888
Nope, nope.

99
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,956
<i>I-I guess, uh, that...
That's it.</i>

100
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,893
Just don't glorzo earth.

101
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:12,628
Just would've been nice
to have heard this sooner.

102
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:14,097
Before we spent all day on it.

103
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:16,432
Yeah, well, I-I'm just hearing
about it, too.

104
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:17,833
<i>You ordered it.
Right.</i>

105
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:19,302
I-I did, and, um...

106
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:21,170
I'm just saying for next time,
maybe put more thought.

107
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:23,038
Into it before a whole day of...

108
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:25,040
Okay, well, I'm sorry I made you
do your job for a day!

109
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:26,175
You look like you were
all really busy.

110
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,911
Before I came
and it all up.

111
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:28,978
<i>Boy, oh boy, huh?
This guy's a genius, but at...</i>

112
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,380
But at what price,
you know?

113
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:31,514
Y'know, you,
Rick!

114
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:33,917
Who's... Rick?

115
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,451
Yeah, well, if we're free
to ask questions,

116
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:38,254
Why haven't you blinked,
uh, for 20 minutes,

117
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:42,309
And why, uh, doesn't
your mouth move when you talk?

118
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:45,861
Ah, geez, look at me.

119
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:47,663
<i>I-I feel down on...
On... on the floor.</i>

120
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:50,199
<i>Oh, let... let me, uh, help...
Help you out here, buddy.</i>

121
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,335
<i>Ah, thanks, man.
Thanks, pal. That's right.</i>

122
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:56,357
<i>I'm right back where... where...
Right back in the saddle here.</i>

123
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:00,876
Alright,
it, run.

124
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:24,834
<i>I-I hate this!
I hate all of this!</i>

125
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,502
Yeah, yeah, keep that feedback
coming, Morty.

126
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,237
It can only help.

127
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,044
Oh,
aw, man!

128
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,646
How big is this city?!

129
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,047
I know,
it's like pick a lane.

130
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,501
Are you face huggers
or industrialists?

131
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,988
Damn, feels kinda good
when there's no guilt, huh?

132
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,656
<i>Yeah, it's...
It's like in "star wars."</i>

133
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,923
Yeah, just like
in "star wars."

134
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:49,793
Go nuts!

135
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:55,264
<i>Nice, Morty! Give a little
"yee-haw" if you want.</i>

136
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,467
<i>They... they always do a little
"yee-haw" like a cowboy.</i>

137
00:05:57,491 --> 00:05:58,601
Yee... yee-ha... yee-haw.

138
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,336
Good enough.

139
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,347
God, I needed this.

140
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,882
Honestly, it's been a while
since I've been able.

141
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:14,083
To just let loose,
you know?

142
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,551
<i>Just have fun.
I'm... I'm...</i>

143
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:17,353
I'm sorry if I've been
taking it out on you.

144
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,755
<i>No, I get it. You got a lot
on your plate, amigo.</i>

145
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,024
I-I just wish you'd open up.

146
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,358
To me more about it
sometimes, you know?

147
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,959
<i>I-I-I'm your partner.
Thanks, Morty.</i>

148
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:25,361
<i>I mean that.
Thank you.</i>

149
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,896
Sometimes, I get a little
in my head, you know?

150
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,298
Hey, man, that head's
a good place to be.

151
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:30,700
Just remember to let me
in sometimes, you know?

152
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,968
<i>- Will do, buddy.
- Mother.</i>

153
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,508
Oh, my god,
this is so much fun!

154
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:39,775
I don't want to stop!

155
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,629
Yeah, it's like
popping bubble wrap.

156
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:52,922
Honestly,
I'm proud of us for not.

157
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:54,590
<i>Totally.
It would've been cheap.</i>

158
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:57,712
Yeah, real low-hanging fruit,
and we're batter than that.

159
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:01,130
Pearl harbor,
on the other hand...

160
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,718
Yeah,
I think that's in-bounds.

161
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:08,872
I am the god of death!

162
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:11,592
Should've been a better species!

163
00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:19,949
So, you did a 9/11?

164
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:21,150
Almost did a 9/11.

165
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:22,818
<i>We... we went with
a pearl harbor.</i>

166
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:24,020
We're pretty classy.

167
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:26,356
Why were either of those
an option?

168
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,623
Ask the saudis.

169
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:28,624
Wow. Damn.

170
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:29,893
Yeah,
getting political.

171
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:31,427
<i>I'm political now.
How 'bout you, jerry?</i>

172
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,963
You got anything to add
to the family dynamic?

173
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:36,817
I've been getting into
beekeeping lately.

174
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,371
Is something wrong
with that?

175
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:42,505
What's wrong with that?

176
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:44,708
Don't I have the right
to be happy? To exist?

177
00:07:44,732 --> 00:07:46,442
I'm sorry I didn't 9/11

178
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,844
Pearl harbor before breakfast,
but I have a life, too!

179
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,446
<i>I have dreams!
And how's summer?</i>

180
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,316
Did she have fun, too?

181
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,184
Oh.
Uh-um.

182
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,986
<i>Summer...
Was...</i>

183
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,388
With us.

184
00:07:58,412 --> 00:07:59,455
There.

185
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,857
You saw us take her
in the car with us.

186
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:04,193
<i>Mm, yes.
Yes, yes, of course.</i>

187
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,395
Th-that's what happened.

188
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:07,341
- And now she's...
- Sleepy.

189
00:08:07,365 --> 00:08:09,399
Um, she's... she's sleepy.

190
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:11,066
<i>Really sleepy.
That's why she's not here.</i>

191
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,335
So sleepy.

192
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:13,737
She's sleepy?!

193
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:14,870
What the hell was that?!

194
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,472
I didn't see you trying
anything!

195
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,141
The bed isn't better
than not the bed!

196
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,361
Where's summer?!

197
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,547
<i>Geez.
Oh, man.</i>

198
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:26,349
You know, maybe we went
too hardcore on these guys.

199
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:27,751
Yeah, why do you think
we never go back.

200
00:08:27,775 --> 00:08:29,285
To a place we've already been?

201
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:30,553
Do you know how many adventures
we could get out.

202
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:31,955
<i>Of purge planet, Morty?
Gear world?</i>

203
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,823
<i>I don't sequel.
It's called integrity.</i>

204
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,091
Here, put this back
on your face.

205
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:37,912
<i>You kept it?
Oh, did you want a new one?</i>

206
00:08:39,787 --> 00:08:40,964
- 'Sup?
- Yo.

207
00:08:40,988 --> 00:08:42,565
Oh,
it's them!

208
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:44,768
The worst thing
to ever happen to us!

209
00:08:44,792 --> 00:08:46,235
Yeah, that makes sense.

210
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,570
Sorry, Morty,
we tried pussin' it.

211
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:48,772
Time to go in hot.

212
00:08:48,796 --> 00:08:51,441
Rickputer, initiate
unnecessarily badass suit-up.

213
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,187
Let's lick.

214
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:13,062
Shouldn't we be finding summer?

215
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:15,264
<i>Oh, right, gee, sorry.
I got caught up again.</i>

216
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,000
God, d-do I need
to take more adderall,

217
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:19,268
Or am I taking
too much adderall?

218
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,012
Man, really shouldn't have gone
with swords.

219
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:30,880
<i>I know.
My wrists are killing me.</i>

220
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,349
Flame-throwers next time,
for sure.

221
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:34,750
Can I get a laser whip?

222
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:39,022
Okay, but there's no way
you don't chop your dick off.

223
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:41,557
Sum sum, come with us
if you want to live...

224
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,959
At a lower standard than this,
I guess.

225
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:45,228
God damn.

226
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,963
<i>Empress, is everything alright?
Ummm...</i>

227
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,098
Seize them!

228
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:50,433
<i>Seize them?!
What?!</i>

229
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:52,820
<i>Summer, you bitch!
You gotta be kidding me!</i>

230
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:57,741
You know that song,
Rick?

231
00:09:57,765 --> 00:09:58,942
<i>From the...
When the prisoners sing it?</i>

232
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:00,410
Come on, Morty,
for sake.

233
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:03,346
<i>It's my jail time.
I-I can spend it however I want.</i>

234
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:06,816
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy!
Hey, hey, hey!</i>

235
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,951
<i>Not in here!
Not in here!</i>

236
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:10,604
<i>Aw...
Gimme that.</i>

237
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:14,290
Leave us.

238
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:16,025
What the
took you so long?!

239
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:17,961
<i>You left me here. We
didn't know you were with us!</i>

240
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:19,829
Do you know how much
I've had to deal with?

241
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:21,297
You're in a cape, summer.

242
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:22,298
How bad could it be?

243
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:24,434
No bad story ends with a cape.

244
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:28,704
You don't know anything
about my story.

245
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:31,641
<i>"I couldn't help but wonder,
was gharkhul really capable."</i>

246
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:33,242
<i>Of consuming a living sun,</i>

247
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:35,979
<i>Or was I simply getting
too close to gharkhul?</i>

248
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:37,647
<i>"Was gharkhul consuming me?"</i>

249
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:39,048
Rick, can we listen
to something else?

250
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:40,850
<i>Quiet! She's just about
to summon gharkhul.</i>

251
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:42,585
She's been talking about
<i>summoning gharkhul.</i>

252
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:43,919
For three episodes,
summer.

253
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:45,721
Wait a minute,
what's that in your mouth?

254
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:47,123
It's a toothpick.

255
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,792
<i>I'm a toothpicker now.
Get used to it.</i>

256
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:50,794
God, are you that desperate
for a thing?

257
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:52,528
It <i>is</i> my thing.

258
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:55,731
Just like yours is dying alone
and yours is jerking off.

259
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:58,668
At least jerking off tracks
for my character, you know?

260
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:01,137
<i>I like to jerk off.
I'm 14. I own it.</i>

261
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,405
<i>Well, I jerk off, too!
Alright, stop.</i>

262
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:04,207
Jesus chris, I don't wanna think
about that.

263
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:05,675
<i>Summer, keep your toothpick.
Gross!</i>

264
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:07,343
Morty, stop talking to
your sister about jerking off.

265
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:08,967
Everyone pretend podcasting
isn't boring.

266
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:14,083
Whoa, Morty, look how
wet this egg is.

267
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:16,085
<i>I dunno, Rick.
That looks a little too wet.</i>

268
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:17,553
<i>D-don't touch it.
Oh, I'm gonna touch it.</i>

269
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:19,022
Why are you guys screaming
at an egg?

270
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:20,356
<i>Shut up, summer!
Just let us look at an egg!</i>

271
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,625
Yeah, summer,
shut the up.

272
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:23,026
Nobody wants you here.

273
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,694
You know, sometimes we like
to go on adventures.

274
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:26,029
And look at wet eggs,
you know? Can we just go?

275
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:27,363
This place is giving me
the creeps.

276
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:28,632
Holy
I love this egg.

277
00:11:28,656 --> 00:11:29,965
Hey, look,
mine's doing it, too.

278
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:32,568
Are you guys sure that's safe?

279
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:34,637
Oh, my god!

280
00:11:38,332 --> 00:11:40,494
All is glorzo.

281
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:46,249
All is glorzo.

282
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,052
- God.
- God.

283
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:51,054
<i>God?
She has a toothpick.</i>

284
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:53,256
Take it out and put her face
in an egg.

285
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,590
- God.
- God.

286
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:56,726
For sake, how long
have you been hatched?

287
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,927
<i>30 seconds?</i>

288
00:11:57,951 --> 00:12:00,196
I've been alive seven minutes.

289
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,465
<i>Think before you...
excuse me, seven minutes?</i>

290
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:04,734
Uh, I've been here
for 29 minutes.

291
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:06,736
But yes, take the toothpick
out of her mouth.

292
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,406
Suck on her face this instant
and use her body to...

293
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:15,679
What was that?

294
00:12:15,703 --> 00:12:18,013
That is called responsibility.

295
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:19,883
He was part of
our greatest generation.

296
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:23,152
He understood that what you need
to do is suck on a face,

297
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:25,020
Shit an egg, and die.

298
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,822
Wait, so, all you do is live
half an hour,

299
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,202
Shit eggs, and die?

300
00:12:28,226 --> 00:12:29,625
<i>Yes.
We love it.</i>

301
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:30,960
I'll do it right now.

302
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:37,166
Okay, you guys don't have
to listen to me,

303
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,102
But I vote you don't do that?

304
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:42,256
And who's up for
changing things around here?

305
00:13:19,767 --> 00:13:22,612
Alright, look, uh, this
been brewing for a while.

306
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:25,481
I'm not gonna win any popularity
contests by saying it,

307
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:27,817
<i>But here's...
Here's the world as I see it.</i>

308
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:45,635
I mean, look, we are designed
to suck on faces and lay eggs.

309
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:48,571
Life is life,
and that's the way it goes.

310
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:56,392
<i>Hello, troy.
Hello, jez.</i>

311
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:58,247
<i>How is it going?
Really good, commander.</i>

312
00:13:58,271 --> 00:13:59,849
Should be ready by tomorrow.

313
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:01,117
That is what I like to hear.

314
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:03,319
Great work,
glory to glorzo.

315
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:06,456
Honestly, summer,
I can't thank you enough.

316
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,058
When we met, we were just
shitting eggs in a cave,

317
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:12,061
But you showed us life
is about more than that.

318
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:13,729
It is about living.

319
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:15,465
And now,
with these missiles,

320
00:14:15,489 --> 00:14:18,334
We will be able to reach
the entire universe.

321
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:22,472
We say it all the time,
but I guess all is glorzo.

322
00:14:22,496 --> 00:14:23,607
Yeah, that sounds great.

323
00:14:23,631 --> 00:14:25,341
<i>And you've been great.
Yeah.</i>

324
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,343
You've been so great
that I've been thinking.

325
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,813
Maybe it's time for you
to get off my brother.

326
00:14:29,837 --> 00:14:31,414
Who's your brother?

327
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:32,348
Oh, this?

328
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,883
Forgot he was there, haha.

329
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:35,551
<i>Wait.
What are you saying?</i>

330
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:37,287
I'm saying that you've
been great, steve,

331
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,823
But we've been thinking
it's time for a new chapter.

332
00:14:39,847 --> 00:14:41,825
<i>We?
Uh, this is shane.</i>

333
00:14:41,849 --> 00:14:43,293
He'll be handling
the day-to-day.

334
00:14:43,317 --> 00:14:44,960
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

335
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:48,782
I might only be two minutes old,
but I know you're a legend.

336
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,233
She doesn't care about us.

337
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:52,368
She just wants her
host back.

338
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,970
<i>I don't know what to do.
Oh, now you want my help.</i>

339
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:56,517
- Too late for that.
- Come on, man.

340
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:57,684
What is this.

341
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:58,908
You don't get to do this to me.

342
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:00,176
We were in eggs together.

343
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,577
Oh, since
we were in eggs.

344
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:02,979
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
now you respect, like,

345
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:04,848
The biological institutions now?

346
00:15:04,872 --> 00:15:06,049
<i>You.
All you care about.</i>

347
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:08,584
Is "progress"
and society and skyscrapers.

348
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:10,386
You don't care about
<i>biology.</i>

349
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,893
Oh, yeah, well,
what the.

350
00:15:11,917 --> 00:15:14,698
<i>You... how you you haven't laid
and egg inside this old man yet?</i>

351
00:15:14,722 --> 00:15:15,925
Because I do what I want.

352
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:17,260
Because someone's gotta
stand up for what's right.

353
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:18,528
Why do you hate her so much?

354
00:15:18,552 --> 00:15:22,065
Because she took you away
from me!

355
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:24,000
<i>Whoa, man.
Jesus christ.</i>

356
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:26,669
<i>No, I-I didn't, I...
Whoa, whoa, whoa. No.</i>

357
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:28,872
It's cool.

358
00:15:28,896 --> 00:15:31,325
I feel the same way.

359
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:37,146
Oh, my god, I...

360
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,748
I wish we could suck
on each other.

361
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:41,351
<i>I wanna suck on you, too.
I'm gonna suck you so hard.</i>

362
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,086
<i>Suck me.
C-c-can we do this?</i>

363
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,554
A-a-are we allowed to do this?

364
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:46,622
<i>I don't care.
I just want you.</i>

365
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:47,490
All of this.

366
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:49,025
Let's just get the hell
outta here.

367
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:51,027
And be whatever
the we want.

368
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:53,496
<i>That's evolution.
That's progress.</i>

369
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,432
<i>I want a family.
Can we have a family.</i>

370
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,486
Yeah.

371
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,895
Aah, aah!

372
00:16:13,873 --> 00:16:14,984
Oh, my god.

373
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:16,786
Holy
oh.

374
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,054
<i>What are... what are these
things?! Do I look like I know?</i>

375
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:21,324
<i>Hey, wait a second.
How'd you know that last part?</i>

376
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:23,259
<i>You weren't there for that.
I had to fill in some gaps.</i>

377
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:25,461
Everyone around the office
knew about steve and bruce.

378
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:29,399
<i>I've got a plan, okay.
You just have to follow my lead.</i>

379
00:16:29,423 --> 00:16:31,867
The punishment is...

380
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:33,202
- Death.
- Mother summer!

381
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:35,271
<i>You said you had a plan!
Silence.</i>

382
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:37,473
The council of glorzos
has spoken.

383
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:38,874
More like council of.

384
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:41,077
- Glorzo is law.
- Silence.

385
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:43,813
The punishment is death.

386
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:46,215
By...
Getting their car.

387
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:48,017
Summer?
Shut up.

388
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,754
Yes, place them in the car.

389
00:16:50,778 --> 00:16:52,021
Those pieces of.

390
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:53,623
<i>No, no, no!
This is like torture.</i>

391
00:16:53,647 --> 00:16:55,759
No, I-I-I-I hate being
in my car.

392
00:16:55,783 --> 00:16:58,361
You deserve it,
you pieces of.

393
00:16:58,385 --> 00:17:00,563
And to make sure
the sentence is passed,

394
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:02,565
I shall be joining them.

395
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:03,699
In the car.

396
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:06,836
And we shall drive away
from here and die.

397
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,237
Oooookay.

398
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:09,839
Guess what, everybody.

399
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:12,642
It's me, the whiny guy
you never want to hear from.

400
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,910
She's trying to escape
with her family.

401
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:15,979
My time to shine.

402
00:17:16,003 --> 00:17:17,447
Execute her.

403
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:20,116
<i>Okay, plan b.
Morty, now.</i>

404
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:23,787
Aah!

405
00:17:23,811 --> 00:17:25,388
Jesus, Morty, that sucks.

406
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:26,790
Alright, stop playing,
Morty.

407
00:17:26,814 --> 00:17:28,124
I-I got this.

408
00:17:29,617 --> 00:17:30,860
Aah!

409
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:38,201
This is what we get
for evolving?

410
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:40,269
Sorry!
Sorry.

411
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:42,538
<i>I-I'm sorry. We... we...
We thought you were evil.</i>

412
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,073
Why would you think that?

413
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:47,210
We had a giant tower
that blared "glorzo is peace."

414
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:49,479
<i>I know.
I... should... should we help?</i>

415
00:17:49,503 --> 00:17:50,814
- Boo!
- Oh, like that's helping.

416
00:17:50,838 --> 00:17:52,748
<i>Got it. Going.
Okay, we're gonna hit the road.</i>

417
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:55,819
<i>You're... you're just going?
You told us to go!</i>

418
00:17:55,843 --> 00:17:58,354
Once again,
I'm so sorry for what they...

419
00:17:58,378 --> 00:17:59,955
<i>You're part of this, too.</i>
Boo!

420
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:01,157
We hate you the most.

421
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:03,226
Get out.

422
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,028
Jesus, summer,
why'd you let these things.

423
00:18:05,052 --> 00:18:06,229
Stay on us for so long?

424
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:07,763
I was working with a lot.

425
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:10,851
Just let me listen
to the podcast next time.

426
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:16,572
Nailed that landing.

427
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:20,776
Huh.
<i>Neat-looking egg.</i>

428
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:28,317
Okay, well, I'm not
cleaning up this

429
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:31,505
aah!

430
00:18:35,082 --> 00:18:37,861
<i>Maybe we, uh... maybe we don't
tell people about this one.</i>

431
00:18:37,885 --> 00:18:39,462
Did we at least learn something?

432
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:41,865
That we suck and everyone sucks?

433
00:18:41,889 --> 00:18:44,667
I guess that counts.

434
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:45,935
Later, chodes.

435
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,955
Hit me on the next one.

436
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:51,675
You know, Rick,
I'm sure you wanna jump.

437
00:18:51,699 --> 00:18:54,344
Into another crazy adventure,
but can we just relax.

438
00:18:54,368 --> 00:18:56,212
And maybe watch
some interdimensional cable?

439
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:58,281
<i>I'm cool if you are.
Honestly, that sounds great.</i>

440
00:18:58,305 --> 00:18:59,883
W-we don't need to try so hard,
you know.

441
00:18:59,907 --> 00:19:01,751
Let's just take it easy
and riff, you know.

442
00:19:01,775 --> 00:19:04,220
<i>That's what I love about us.
Me, too, buddy.</i>

443
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:06,089
<i>Do you suffer
from alzheimer's?</i>

444
00:19:06,113 --> 00:19:07,691
Do you suffer from alzheimer's?

445
00:19:07,715 --> 00:19:09,492
Do you suffer from alzheimer's?

446
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:10,760
Do you suffer from alzheimer's?

447
00:19:10,784 --> 00:19:12,628
- Reggie?
- Do you suffer from alzheimer's?

448
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,097
<i>Reggie,
you alright in there?</i>

449
00:19:14,121 --> 00:19:16,432
Mm, Rick, do you feel...

450
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:18,968
Oh, god,
I have to shit an egg.

451
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:20,169
Oh, my god,
oh,

452
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:21,712
<i>Oh, it hurts.
Oh god,</i>

453
00:19:21,736 --> 00:19:22,774
Is this how we die, Rick?

454
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:25,493
- I don't know, Morty. I don't know! Aah!
- Is this how we die?!

455
00:19:25,517 --> 00:19:27,328
- I don't want to an egg,
- Rick! I'm sorry, Morty.

456
00:19:27,352 --> 00:19:29,171
<i>I'm sorry! It's my fault.
It's all my fault!</i>

457
00:19:29,195 --> 00:19:30,308
Hey, you two. Did you...

458
00:19:30,332 --> 00:19:32,643
<i>Beth, your son is dying!
Say goodbye!</i>

459
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:35,305
<i>What are you... say
goodbye to your little boy!</i>

460
00:19:35,329 --> 00:19:36,092
No, look away!

461
00:19:36,116 --> 00:19:37,853
<i>I'm making an egg, mom.
I'm making an egg!</i>

462
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:40,523
You said you'd keep me more
in the loop this year.

463
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:42,992
<i>Look away, beth!
Daddy loves you!</i>

464
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:44,260
<i>My ass!
My ass!</i>

465
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:45,461
This is it, Morty!

466
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:47,130
It's full circle from the pilot.

467
00:19:47,154 --> 00:19:48,398
Full circle!

468
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:55,671
Oh, I guess we, uh...

469
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:56,872
I guess we both just had
to take a.

470
00:19:56,896 --> 00:19:58,742
Yeah,
I-I-I guess we, uh...

471
00:19:58,766 --> 00:20:00,009
gross.

472
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:02,011
Guys, clean it up.

473
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:36,179
Look at your dad.

474
00:20:36,203 --> 00:20:39,649
Such a dork,
keeping bees.

475
00:20:39,673 --> 00:20:41,785
<i>I mean, it's... at least
it's interesting, though.</i>

476
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:45,106
<i>At least, like...
I wish my dad kept bees.</i>

477
00:20:45,613 --> 00:20:47,123
I mean,
it's kind of cute.

478
00:20:47,147 --> 00:20:52,128
<i>Like...
Your dad keeps bees.</i>

479
00:20:52,152 --> 00:20:54,397
How old is your dad?

480
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:59,004
He's obviously
beekeeping age.

481
00:20:59,127 --> 00:21:02,524
I don't know,
I think it's kind of sweet.

482
00:21:04,594 --> 00:21:06,264
Summer, I want to
your dad.

483
00:21:06,288 --> 00:21:07,851
Oh, really?
