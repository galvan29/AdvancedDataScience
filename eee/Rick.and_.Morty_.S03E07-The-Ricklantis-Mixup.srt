1
00:00:01,344 --> 00:00:02,838
All right, Morty,
you ready for our adventure

2
00:00:02,885 --> 00:00:04,298
to the Lost City
of Atlantis?

3
00:00:04,353 --> 00:00:05,571
Ready as I'll ever be,
Rick.

4
00:00:05,619 --> 00:00:07,322
For [Bleep] sake.

5
00:00:07,408 --> 00:00:10,025
Hello, I'm Rick K-22.
This is my Morty.

6
00:00:10,072 --> 00:00:11,736
We're going from
reality to reality

7
00:00:11,784 --> 00:00:13,189
asking Ricks to contribute

8
00:00:13,228 --> 00:00:15,931
to the Citadel of Ricks
Redevelopment Fund.

9
00:00:15,979 --> 00:00:16,986
What are you,
stupid?

10
00:00:17,034 --> 00:00:18,501
We're done with
the Citadel of Ricks.

11
00:00:18,549 --> 00:00:20,728
I was never on board
with it in the first place.

12
00:00:20,776 --> 00:00:22,267
That's why
I murdered everyone in charge

13
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:23,321
and left it to rot.

14
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:25,056
That was you.

15
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:27,712
They tried to murder him first.
Aw, geez.

16
00:00:27,798 --> 00:00:29,319
Well,
you'll be happy to know

17
00:00:29,367 --> 00:00:30,508
that the council's
gone now...

18
00:00:30,555 --> 00:00:32,202
Yeah, he knows.
<i>He</i> murdered them.

19
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,394
You want to rein in your Morty?
Every day.

20
00:00:34,441 --> 00:00:36,334
The Citadel of Ricks
Redevelopment Fund

21
00:00:36,382 --> 00:00:38,538
- donates...
- Morty, he's not gonna... donate.

22
00:00:38,608 --> 00:00:40,389
You're pitching
the Policeman's Ball

23
00:00:40,437 --> 00:00:41,568
to a black teenager here.

24
00:00:41,615 --> 00:00:43,210
Let's go. You don't
have to be a dick.

25
00:00:43,258 --> 00:00:45,296
- I think you know that's not true.
- Geez.

26
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,734
I didn't know there were
still Ricks and Mortys

27
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:47,749
living on the Citadel.

28
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:48,964
I wonder what their
day-to-day lives are like.

29
00:00:49,011 --> 00:00:50,482
Well, you can keep
wondering that

30
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:51,671
while we go
on a fun, fresh,

31
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,530
self-contained adventure
to Atlantis.

32
00:00:53,897 --> 00:00:56,873
Anyone continuing to explore
the Citadel is either stupid

33
00:00:56,921 --> 00:00:58,296
or one of
the unfortunate millions

34
00:00:58,344 --> 00:01:00,199
held hostage
by their terrible ideas.

35
00:01:00,265 --> 00:01:02,420
Man, I'm glad
I'm not one of them!

Good morning.
I'm Rick D-716B.

And I'm Rick D-716.
Must be nice.

45

Coming up, gravity outages
in East Sanchez Heights...

46
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:04,055
And, is your uranium-powered

47
00:02:04,103 --> 00:02:05,117

It's...
Yes, it's uranium.

00:02:08,813 --> 00:02:11,110
Those stories and more,
after this break.

51
00:02:11,274 --> 00:02:14,172
60 iterations
off the central finite curve,

52
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,368
there's a Rick
that works more with wood

53
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:18,243
than polarity plating.

54
00:02:18,468 --> 00:02:21,392
His name is Simple Rick
but he's no dummy.

55
00:02:21,448 --> 00:02:22,993
He realized long ago

56
00:02:23,071 --> 00:02:24,985
that the greatest thing
he'd ever create

57
00:02:25,033 --> 00:02:27,008
- was his daughter.
- I love Daddy!

58
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:28,580
We captured that moment...

59
00:02:28,628 --> 00:02:31,063
We run it on a loop
through Simple Rick's mind...

60
00:02:31,203 --> 00:02:33,414
And the chemical
it makes his brain secrete

61
00:02:33,462 --> 00:02:36,661
goes into every Simple Rick's
"Simple Wafers" Wafer Cookie.

62
00:02:36,749 --> 00:02:38,719
Come home to
the impossible flavor

63
00:02:38,774 --> 00:02:40,094
of your own completion.

64
00:02:40,192 --> 00:02:42,071
Come home to Simple Rick's.

65
00:02:42,235 --> 00:02:43,356
Just one day remains

66
00:02:43,403 --> 00:02:45,171
before our
newly democratic Citadel

67
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:46,585
elects its first President,

68
00:02:46,655 --> 00:02:48,851
it's anyone's race
among the Rick candidates.

69
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:50,312
But a certain
other candidate

70
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,912
should be getting
at least one vote

71
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,296
for most adorable.

72
00:02:53,344 --> 00:02:56,248
That's right. The Morty party
candidate's still in the race,

73
00:02:56,296 --> 00:02:58,004
and you just gotta
love him for that.

74
00:02:58,051 --> 00:03:00,132
Here you see him in his little
Morty suit waving...

75
00:03:00,192 --> 00:03:02,209
Isn't that adorable?
Little jackass.

76
00:03:02,257 --> 00:03:03,530
Yeah,
I think we actually have

77
00:03:03,578 --> 00:03:05,062
the audio
for his speech here...

78
00:03:05,103 --> 00:03:06,491
Aw, geez. Aw, man.

79
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:08,257
I'm gonna lose the election
and stuff.

80
00:03:10,111 --> 00:03:11,432
We had a good run, sir,

81
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,523
but I think it's time
to pull out of the race.

82
00:03:13,618 --> 00:03:15,710
I feel pretty confident
about tonight's debate.

83
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:18,359
You shouldn't, sir.
You should be terrified.

84
00:03:18,447 --> 00:03:20,694
Maybe you should find
a little faith, young man.

85
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:22,913
You don't pay me
to have faith.

86
00:03:23,104 --> 00:03:24,804
And we're the same age!

87
00:03:32,185 --> 00:03:33,618
- Aah!
- Whoa!

88
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:37,609
Oh! Sorry.
I-I was expecting...

89
00:03:37,657 --> 00:03:38,712
A Rick partner?

90
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,226
Lesson one, rookie,
expect the unexpected.

91
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,452
Now, get in.

92
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:45,710
Mortys are human!

93
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:48,114
Get the [Bleep] off the car,
you Rickless [Bleep] animal!

94
00:03:48,179 --> 00:03:50,507
- Whoa!
- The election's got these yellow shirts

95
00:03:50,555 --> 00:03:52,543
more riled up than
a picture-day Jessica.

96
00:03:52,591 --> 00:03:53,800
That's pretty harsh, sir.

97
00:03:53,848 --> 00:03:55,460
So report me.
Nobody gives a [Bleep]

98
00:03:55,508 --> 00:03:57,266
Look, I'm just saying,
it makes me a little sad

99
00:03:57,313 --> 00:03:59,382
to hear a Morty cop
calling Mortys animals.

100
00:03:59,446 --> 00:04:01,334
Well, it makes me sad to hear
another Rick cop

101
00:04:01,382 --> 00:04:03,054
buying into his
sensitivity training.

102
00:04:03,102 --> 00:04:04,733
Well, I'm glad to know
there's more like me.

103
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,929
There was one.

104
00:04:05,977 --> 00:04:07,874
Why do you think that
seat was empty?

105
00:04:08,335 --> 00:04:10,664
<i>Robbery at Fifth
and Avenue.</i>

106
00:04:10,741 --> 00:04:11,913
Fifth and

107
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,999
- That's Morty Town.
- Unit seven responding.

108
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:18,781
Good idea, Rick.

109
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,258
Good idea, Rick.

110
00:04:20,305 --> 00:04:22,170
This is a great adventure.

111
00:04:22,218 --> 00:04:24,002
This is a great adventure.

112
00:04:24,049 --> 00:04:26,194
I love being
your new Morty.

113
00:04:26,296 --> 00:04:29,319
I love being
your new Mor... Farty.

114
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:31,226
Very amusing, Mr. Smith.

115
00:04:31,303 --> 00:04:33,257
Almost as amusing as
when your first Rick

116
00:04:33,305 --> 00:04:35,569
was decapitated on
Zorpantheon Nine.

117
00:04:35,682 --> 00:04:37,048
Or was that
your third Rick?

118
00:04:37,095 --> 00:04:38,616
How many Ricks
have you had?

119
00:04:38,663 --> 00:04:40,038
- Five.
- I see.

120
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,796
So you<i> are</i> top of the class
in something.

121
00:04:43,007 --> 00:04:44,991
Tomorrow you'll be
transferred to your new Ricks.

122
00:04:45,103 --> 00:04:47,125
Hopefully
they will be your last.

123
00:04:47,327 --> 00:04:49,288
Yes, Slow Ri...
Tall Morty?

124
00:04:49,382 --> 00:04:51,937
Di... did I gradgitate
this time yet?

125
00:04:52,007 --> 00:04:53,984
Anything's possible,
Tall Morty.

126
00:04:57,773 --> 00:05:00,318
I guess we won't be seeing
each other after this?

127
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:02,296
I say we make
our last day count.

128
00:05:02,476 --> 00:05:04,834
I say... we go to
the Wishing Portal.

129
00:05:04,882 --> 00:05:06,773
- That's a myth.
- It's not a myth.

130
00:05:06,952 --> 00:05:08,209
My first Rick's fourth Morty

131
00:05:08,257 --> 00:05:09,818
knew a Rick
whose Morty went there.

132
00:05:09,866 --> 00:05:11,187
If we're not here
for graduation,

133
00:05:11,257 --> 00:05:13,046
our butts are gonna wind up
in Morty Town.

134
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,288
I thought your last Rick
fused you with a lizard,

135
00:05:15,366 --> 00:05:16,460
not a chicken.

136
00:05:16,562 --> 00:05:17,921
Okay, fine. I'm in.

137
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:19,157
Me too.

138
00:05:19,859 --> 00:05:22,952
What the hell?!
I thought I saw a fly.

139
00:05:32,372 --> 00:05:33,980
Listen up, [Bleep] nuts.

140
00:05:34,074 --> 00:05:35,940
I've been your supervisor
for five years,

141
00:05:35,987 --> 00:05:37,880
but all shitty things
must come to an end

142
00:05:37,928 --> 00:05:40,364
and I have been promoted
to Regional Manager.

143
00:05:41,302 --> 00:05:43,629
Yeah, I feel the same way,
may be never meet again.

144
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,084
Of course, that makes the position
of supervisor available,

145
00:05:46,131 --> 00:05:48,720
so, as of next week,
the ass you'll be kissing

146
00:05:48,767 --> 00:05:50,076
will be that of...

147
00:05:50,411 --> 00:05:53,294
K-83, affectionately
known as Cool Rick.

148
00:05:53,747 --> 00:05:55,321
I know
I'm new to the Citadel,

149
00:05:55,369 --> 00:05:57,474
and some of you might not think
I put in my time,

150
00:05:57,522 --> 00:05:58,810
but what can I say?

151
00:05:58,910 --> 00:05:59,986
I'm Cool Rick!

152
00:06:00,033 --> 00:06:01,817
Yo! Ha! Ha!
Check me out!

153
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,224
All right knuckleheads,
any questions?

154
00:06:04,983 --> 00:06:07,810
All right, then, back to work,
you gold Rickers.

155
00:06:16,811 --> 00:06:18,933
No Ricks, no families,

156
00:06:18,998 --> 00:06:21,233
high off their asses,
and running amuck.

157
00:06:21,331 --> 00:06:23,162
Mortys are raised
to be sidekicks.

158
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:26,428
Without a side to kick,
they just start kicking.

159
00:06:26,926 --> 00:06:28,693
They were...
They were about my height,

160
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,016
around 14 years old...

161
00:06:30,063 --> 00:06:31,685
their... their shirts
were yellow!

162
00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:33,162
Yeah, make sure
you get<i> that</i> down.

163
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,991
Any mutations,
augmentations?

164
00:06:35,068 --> 00:06:37,135
Three eyes? A tail?
Maybe a buzz cut?

165
00:06:37,182 --> 00:06:38,803
No.
Just four normal Mortys.

166
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,660
Normal?
Put it in your blog.

167
00:06:40,707 --> 00:06:42,459
Let me turn over
a few rocks.

168
00:06:42,623 --> 00:06:45,198
Aw, geez.
Hey, what's goin' on, fellas?

169
00:06:45,245 --> 00:06:46,639
Aw, geez, man.
Nothing, man.

170
00:06:46,687 --> 00:06:48,012
We're just hanging out
and stuff.

171
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:49,202
I hear that. Aw, geez.

172
00:06:49,249 --> 00:06:50,538
I guess I'm supposed to be
figurin' out

173
00:06:50,585 --> 00:06:52,138
who robbed the store
across the street.

174
00:06:52,186 --> 00:06:53,740
But, aw, geez,
I don't know.

175
00:06:53,787 --> 00:06:54,936
Aw, geez man, that sucks

176
00:06:54,984 --> 00:06:56,474
that your Rick's
making you do that.

177
00:06:56,522 --> 00:06:58,778
He's not my Rick.
He's my partner.

178
00:06:58,826 --> 00:07:00,079
Aw, geez.

179
00:07:00,126 --> 00:07:02,527
Well, maybe the uniform
makes a big difference,

180
00:07:02,574 --> 00:07:03,750
who am I to say.

181
00:07:03,797 --> 00:07:06,152
To me, you just look
like a sidekick.

182
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:08,177
Whoa! Call me a
sidekick one more time!

183
00:07:08,225 --> 00:07:10,061
Call me a sidekick!
Hey, man! Come on! Aw, geez!

184
00:07:10,108 --> 00:07:11,349
Wanna see
how I paint a wall?!

185
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:12,872
It was
the Morty Town Locos, man!

186
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,420
The...
The Morty Town Locos!

187
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:16,028
Aah!
Aah!

188
00:07:16,076 --> 00:07:18,126
Do you realize how many codes
you just violated?

189
00:07:18,323 --> 00:07:19,198
Aw, geez, Rick.

190
00:07:19,245 --> 00:07:20,834
What do I know about
knowin' stuff?

191
00:07:20,882 --> 00:07:22,584
Get in the [Bleep] car.

192
00:07:22,632 --> 00:07:23,747
More lasers.

193
00:07:23,795 --> 00:07:24,959
You could take more time

194
00:07:25,007 --> 00:07:26,670
to answer the question
if you like.

195
00:07:28,701 --> 00:07:30,476
Okay, Juggling Rick,

196
00:07:30,523 --> 00:07:33,022
how would you solve
the Citadel's financial crisis?

197
00:07:33,076 --> 00:07:34,147
First off,
can I just say

198
00:07:34,195 --> 00:07:36,050
that I believe this Citadel
is the greatest

199
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,592
in the entire multi-verse.

200
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:39,787
Now, I believe
the answer to your question

201
00:07:39,873 --> 00:07:41,123
has three parts.

202
00:07:41,186 --> 00:07:45,024
First, education spending
must get<i> much</i> higher...

203
00:07:45,071 --> 00:07:46,993
<i>But it has to be balanced
with defense...</i>

204
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,040
- <i>Whoa! Whoa!</i>
- Can we fact check this please?

205
00:07:49,087 --> 00:07:50,389
Never mind.
Who am I kidding.

206
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:51,975
This race is over.

207
00:07:52,162 --> 00:07:55,061
And that's how you run
a Citadel!

208
00:07:55,756 --> 00:07:56,897
Candidate Morty,

209
00:07:56,945 --> 00:07:58,825
the number of displaced Mortys
is soaring

210
00:07:58,873 --> 00:08:00,951
while Rick satisfaction levels
are plummeting,

211
00:08:01,061 --> 00:08:02,553
and the divide
between the two groups

212
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,654
has never been wider.

213
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:05,342
Solve that one real quick.

214
00:08:07,686 --> 00:08:09,861
I don't see a divide
between Ricks and Mortys...

215
00:08:09,908 --> 00:08:11,069
Shocker.

216
00:08:12,514 --> 00:08:14,303
I'd like to offer
a re-buttal.

217
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:15,679
Gentlemen, gentlemen,

218
00:08:15,727 --> 00:08:17,187
I think we can all agree
on one thing...

219
00:08:17,234 --> 00:08:19,264
Well, it came out
as two things

220
00:08:19,312 --> 00:08:20,795
but you get the idea.

221
00:08:21,215 --> 00:08:22,736
You guys finished?

222
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,731
The division I see

223
00:08:24,778 --> 00:08:25,977
is between
the Ricks and Mortys

224
00:08:26,024 --> 00:08:27,699
that like
the Citadel divided...

225
00:08:27,853 --> 00:08:29,270
and the rest of us.

226
00:08:30,324 --> 00:08:31,904
I see it everywhere I go.

227
00:08:31,952 --> 00:08:33,238
I see it in our schools

228
00:08:33,286 --> 00:08:35,051
where they teach Mortys
we're all the same,

229
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:37,288
because they're threatened by
what makes us unique.

230
00:08:37,336 --> 00:08:38,559
I see it in our streets

231
00:08:38,629 --> 00:08:40,293
where they give guns
to Mortys,

232
00:08:40,371 --> 00:08:42,004
so we're too busy
fighting each other

233
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,676
to fight real injustice.

234
00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:45,145
I see it in our factories

235
00:08:45,193 --> 00:08:47,798
where Ricks work for a fraction
of their boss' salary

236
00:08:47,846 --> 00:08:50,895
even though they're identical
and have the same IQ.

237
00:08:51,893 --> 00:08:54,074
<i>The Citadel's problem
isn't homeless Mortys</i>

238
00:08:54,122 --> 00:08:55,512
<i>or outraged Ricks.</i>

239
00:08:59,066 --> 00:09:01,347
<i>The Citadel's problem
is the Ricks and Mortys</i>

240
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:02,996
<i>feeding on
the Citadel's death...</i>

241
00:09:03,044 --> 00:09:04,410
Holy [Bleep]

242
00:09:04,775 --> 00:09:06,816
He's headed for the flavor core!

243
00:09:06,863 --> 00:09:08,895
<i>But I've got
a message for them,</i>

244
00:09:09,246 --> 00:09:11,848
<i>from the Ricks and Mortys
keeping it alive,</i>

245
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:15,754
<i>a message
from the Ricks and Mortys</i>

246
00:09:15,816 --> 00:09:17,598
that believe in this Citadel

247
00:09:17,785 --> 00:09:20,504
to the Ricks and Mortys
that don't.

248
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:23,160
You're outnumbered.

249
00:09:28,539 --> 00:09:30,789
Holy [Bleep]

250
00:09:31,403 --> 00:09:32,624
I don't believe it.

251
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:34,015
I-I<i> can't</i> believe it.

252
00:09:34,063 --> 00:09:36,438
I know.
That's why you're fired.

253
00:09:38,348 --> 00:09:39,684
Sounds like
you're looking for work.

254
00:09:39,731 --> 00:09:42,465
I can offer you a very enticing
compensation package.

255
00:09:42,557 --> 00:09:44,412
First,
let's talk benefits...

256
00:09:44,515 --> 00:09:47,487
Daddy loves you.
That's Daddy's good girl.

257
00:09:47,535 --> 00:09:48,956
Your life is a lie, man.

258
00:09:49,004 --> 00:09:50,073
All your life's are lies!

259
00:09:50,121 --> 00:09:51,104
Don't you get it?!

260
00:09:51,152 --> 00:09:52,918
They told us we were special
because we were Ricks,

261
00:09:52,965 --> 00:09:54,942
but they stripped us of
everything that made us unique!

262
00:09:54,989 --> 00:09:56,034
We know how you feel.

263
00:09:56,082 --> 00:09:57,799
We're working-stiff Ricks
just like you.

264
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,660
But our assembly line
is justice.

265
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:00,823
What are your demands?

266
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:02,378
I-I-I want a portal gun.

267
00:10:02,426 --> 00:10:03,799
Unregistered, untraceable,

268
00:10:03,847 --> 00:10:06,676
with enough fluid to take me off
this God damn prison!

269
00:10:06,871 --> 00:10:09,293
The media's outside.
Well, keep 'em there.

270
00:10:09,363 --> 00:10:12,128
Anyway, so yeah, the suspect
says the Citadel's a lie,

271
00:10:12,176 --> 00:10:13,407
built on lies,
and some other shit.

272
00:10:13,454 --> 00:10:16,001
I say appreciate
the life you have,

273
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,796
because it can always
be worse.

274
00:10:17,844 --> 00:10:18,884
Back to you, Ricks.

275
00:10:18,946 --> 00:10:20,774
Thank you, Rick 0716-C.

276
00:10:20,876 --> 00:10:22,500
That [Bleep] guy.
Tell me about it.

277
00:10:22,548 --> 00:10:24,223
Meanwhile,
in election news,

278
00:10:24,271 --> 00:10:25,605
an unexpected turn of events

279
00:10:25,653 --> 00:10:27,206
as Morty
from the Morty Party

280
00:10:27,254 --> 00:10:28,942
soars to
the top of the polls.

281
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:31,105
Yes.

282
00:10:31,153 --> 00:10:33,520
Morty, what's your original
reality and where's your Rick?

283
00:10:33,598 --> 00:10:36,598
Gosh, we moved around so much
it's hard to remember.

284
00:10:36,661 --> 00:10:38,286
I see every Rick
as my Rick,

285
00:10:38,341 --> 00:10:40,262
<i>I hope they see me as their Morty.</i>

286
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,208
Another? Please?
With less water?

287
00:10:43,256 --> 00:10:44,497
Hey, cheer up, pal.

288
00:10:44,545 --> 00:10:46,051
A Morty's
gonna be president.

289
00:10:46,136 --> 00:10:47,403
Imagine this kisser

290
00:10:47,451 --> 00:10:49,051
getting blamed
for everything.

291
00:10:49,194 --> 00:10:50,762
I guess I should've had
more faith.

292
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:53,700
It's not faith you need.
It's fear.

293
00:10:55,473 --> 00:10:56,793
What's this?

294
00:10:57,288 --> 00:10:58,556
It's secrets.

295
00:10:58,604 --> 00:10:59,898
Wh... wh... wh...
What do you think it is?

296
00:10:59,945 --> 00:11:00,890
Look at how I'm dressed.

297
00:11:00,938 --> 00:11:02,238
<i>Having taken aim
at the system,</i>

298
00:11:02,285 --> 00:11:03,838
<i>are afraid at all
for your safety?</i>

299
00:11:03,901 --> 00:11:05,518
<i>I'd rather
live in hope than fear.</i>

300
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:07,063
<i>If I had to fear anything,</i>

301
00:11:07,152 --> 00:11:08,781
<i>I'd fear other people
being afraid.</i>

302
00:11:08,829 --> 00:11:10,195
<i>Of fear. Itself.</i>

303
00:11:10,243 --> 00:11:12,149
<i>But. No, I'm not afraid.</i>

304
00:11:12,196 --> 00:11:14,125
Hey Rick man,
when is the Morty president?

305
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,641
You gonna lick my balls
or what?

306
00:11:15,689 --> 00:11:16,863
Sheeeet, grandson,

307
00:11:16,911 --> 00:11:19,542
you keep me peelin' skrabquams
and slippin' nib nibs,

308
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,730
I'll lick whatever
ain't nailed down.

309
00:11:22,527 --> 00:11:23,719
Hands in the air!

310
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,588
What the hell, man?!
What the hellin' hell?

311
00:11:25,635 --> 00:11:27,199
You guys doing a little
chemistry homework

312
00:11:27,246 --> 00:11:29,120
- with Grandpa?
- Is this what I think it is?

313
00:11:29,168 --> 00:11:30,589
Bootleg portal fluid.

314
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,556
I guess his math was off.

315
00:11:36,604 --> 00:11:38,025
Search the place.

316
00:11:42,383 --> 00:11:45,503
Are... are you...
my new... R... Rick?

317
00:11:45,613 --> 00:11:47,113
It's okay, Morty.

318
00:11:52,762 --> 00:11:53,910
Jesus.

319
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,784
He stabbed me.
He got me bad, Morty.

320
00:11:55,832 --> 00:11:57,301
Shh. It's okay.
You're okay.

321
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:58,574
You were right.

322
00:11:58,622 --> 00:11:59,738
Everything I learned at the

323
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:01,019
- academy was...
- Doesn't matter.

324
00:12:01,066 --> 00:12:03,206
Nothing's wrong with putting
your faith in a Morty.

325
00:12:03,324 --> 00:12:05,112
You just gotta pick
the right one.

326
00:12:05,235 --> 00:12:06,777
Why is there a crib
in here?

327
00:12:06,855 --> 00:12:09,152
Something they do.
To make you feel bad.

328
00:12:09,355 --> 00:12:11,434
Boy, I got us knee-deep
in paperwork?

329
00:12:11,502 --> 00:12:13,176
Go to the car
and grab a medi-pack.

330
00:12:13,234 --> 00:12:14,889
Let me worry about this.

331
00:12:22,071 --> 00:12:24,137
What happened?
Same old story...

332
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,160
Mortys killing Mortys.

333
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:32,371
Almost... got it...

334
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:33,464
Hey!

335
00:12:33,512 --> 00:12:36,113
Y'all get the hell away
from my damn mega fruit!

336
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,074
Sic 'em, boy!

337
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:39,746
I don't wear
this dag-nab hat

338
00:12:39,794 --> 00:12:41,176
and commit
to this rural character

339
00:12:41,224 --> 00:12:43,621
so you can eat for free
while you come of age!

340
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,769
I bet the Wishing Portal
leads to a reality

341
00:12:45,817 --> 00:12:46,926
where they're...
Where all...

342
00:12:46,973 --> 00:12:48,902
Where it's a bunch of
French toast with boobies.

343
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,043
I bet it leads to a place
with a bunch of fry...

344
00:12:51,158 --> 00:12:52,679
Fly... flies everywhere.

345
00:12:52,765 --> 00:12:54,262
Yeah, I bet it goes nowhere.

346
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,323
I bet it's a big hole

347
00:12:55,371 --> 00:12:57,466
where the Citadel dumps
all its broken dreams.

348
00:12:57,514 --> 00:12:59,603
Slick, why do you have to be
so dramatic?

349
00:12:59,651 --> 00:13:01,512
You wanna know why?
Because of this.

350
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,711
I'm part of
an experimental line of Mortys

351
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:05,098
with a drama implant.

352
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:07,119
How do you think it feels,
Fat Morty,

353
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,793
to know that
no matter where I go,

354
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,012
I'll always be the one

355
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,371
that makes everybody sad
and a little bored.

356
00:13:12,434 --> 00:13:14,824
Slick, that implant
isn't who you are, okay?

357
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:17,160
You also
roll up your sleeves.

358
00:13:17,371 --> 00:13:19,715
I thought
I was Left-Handed Morty.

359
00:13:19,848 --> 00:13:21,292
Then you should
use your left hand

360
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,589
to eat more vegetables.

361
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:25,036
Hey, there. How you doing?
Great to meet you.

362
00:13:25,084 --> 00:13:26,113
I'm a plumber, sir.

363
00:13:26,161 --> 00:13:27,324
I'm a Rick,
and I'm a plumber.

364
00:13:27,372 --> 00:13:28,737
That doesn't sound like
Rick work.

365
00:13:28,785 --> 00:13:30,733
You didn't come to the Citadel
to be a plumber, did you?

366
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,065
Ha! Ha!
I sure didn't, sir!

367
00:13:32,113 --> 00:13:33,160
Mr. Morty! Mr. Morty!

368
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,204
I cloned myself so you could
kiss me as a baby!

369
00:13:35,252 --> 00:13:37,199
This is just like
a Morty baby!

370
00:13:39,238 --> 00:13:41,954
Hey, did you,
end up getting a new job?

371
00:13:42,001 --> 00:13:43,010
Yeah, I did.

372
00:13:43,057 --> 00:13:44,644
Assassinating you.

373
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:47,199
I'm okay...

374
00:13:47,254 --> 00:13:48,644
I'm okay...

375
00:13:48,692 --> 00:13:49,980
I'm...

376
00:13:54,902 --> 00:13:57,316
Aw, man. Aw, geez.

377
00:13:57,494 --> 00:13:58,605
Aw, hah.

378
00:13:58,746 --> 00:14:00,651
You look like you could use
a good time.

379
00:14:00,699 --> 00:14:03,008
One dance for $10,
two for $25.

380
00:14:03,055 --> 00:14:05,121
No, thank you...
And bad math.

381
00:14:05,355 --> 00:14:07,441
Ha! Ha! Yeah!
This is a good time!

382
00:14:07,543 --> 00:14:09,777
What is this place?
The Creepy Morty.

383
00:14:09,871 --> 00:14:11,380
What is it your kind's
always saying...

384
00:14:11,427 --> 00:14:12,677
"Don't think about it."

385
00:14:12,725 --> 00:14:13,832
Come on.

386
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,691
There's someone important
I want you to meet.

387
00:14:15,801 --> 00:14:17,478
Bubbala!

388
00:14:17,793 --> 00:14:19,879
How'd it go with
the Morty Town Locos?

389
00:14:19,965 --> 00:14:21,089
They had
a little accident.

390
00:14:21,137 --> 00:14:23,221
They won't be causing
any trouble anymore.

391
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:27,066
Those were bad Mortys.
Very bad Mortys.

392
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,542
Big Morty
likes to contribute

393
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,303
to keeping the peace
in Morty Town.

394
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,938
Think of him
as a "drug lord"

395
00:14:32,987 --> 00:14:35,048
and us as
cops on his payroll.

396
00:14:35,105 --> 00:14:35,862
Morty...

397
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:36,801
- Which Morty?
- Which Morty?

398
00:14:36,849 --> 00:14:38,129
M... m... my partner.

399
00:14:38,223 --> 00:14:40,234
Morty, you're right.
Morty Town is bad.

400
00:14:40,281 --> 00:14:42,191
But that doesn't mean
that we have to be.

401
00:14:42,239 --> 00:14:43,808
Hey, what's going on here,
Morty?

402
00:14:43,863 --> 00:14:45,055
- Which Morty?
- Which Morty?

403
00:14:45,103 --> 00:14:46,394
The cop, morons!

404
00:14:46,442 --> 00:14:47,855
Don't worry about Rick,
Big Morty.

405
00:14:47,903 --> 00:14:48,950
He's new.

406
00:14:48,998 --> 00:14:50,926
He doesn't understand
how it works.

407
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,637
That's what you said
about your last partner.

408
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,471
Why would you say something
like that, Big Morty?

409
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:58,660
You're [Bleep] things up for
both of us here.

410
00:14:58,708 --> 00:14:59,550
Wrong.

411
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:01,879
He's [Bleep] things up
for both of you.

412
00:15:01,997 --> 00:15:04,419
Unless he takes
the money.

413
00:15:05,248 --> 00:15:06,914
Big Morty,
you're under arrest.

414
00:15:07,014 --> 00:15:09,131
S... smartest man
in the universe.

415
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:17,839
They're just props!
Th... they're just props!

416
00:15:19,823 --> 00:15:21,275
Not so
big now, are ya?

417
00:15:21,322 --> 00:15:23,136
I never was!
It was figurative!

418
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,324
That's enough. If we don't
kill him, he'll talk.

419
00:15:25,371 --> 00:15:26,917
If you do, I'll talk.

420
00:15:26,965 --> 00:15:28,321
O... one thing's for sure,

421
00:15:28,368 --> 00:15:30,947
Y... y'all don't have to worry
about Cowboy Morty talkin'.

422
00:15:30,995 --> 00:15:34,190
This little cowpoke's gonna
mosey up on out of here.

423
00:15:34,261 --> 00:15:36,401
You told me to put my faith
in the right Morty.

424
00:15:36,526 --> 00:15:38,103
I've got faith in you,
partner.

425
00:15:38,196 --> 00:15:39,884
Do the right thing.

426
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,369
Grandpa Rick,

427
00:15:42,417 --> 00:15:44,300
I-I don't wanna be
on the Citadel anymore.

428
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,011
I wanna be a regular kid.

429
00:15:46,096 --> 00:15:48,113
I-I wanna to go to school
and throw balls around

430
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,681
and masturbate.

431
00:15:57,932 --> 00:15:59,324
What the hell happened
in there?

432
00:15:59,495 --> 00:16:00,698
Same old story.

433
00:16:00,848 --> 00:16:02,495
Ricks killing Mortys.

434
00:16:03,018 --> 00:16:05,564
Okay, man, okay,
we got your portal gun.

435
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:13,071
What the hell's
he doing?

436
00:16:13,268 --> 00:16:15,581
Where... where am I?
A bad place.

437
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:17,242
But you're going
to a better one soon.

438
00:16:17,289 --> 00:16:19,440
Hey! Hey!

439
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:20,678
No, no, no, no...

440
00:16:20,726 --> 00:16:21,776
Whaa...

441
00:16:21,824 --> 00:16:22,908
God damn it!

442
00:16:22,956 --> 00:16:24,581
A portal to
the blender dimension?

443
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:26,080
That's the oldest tRick
in the book!

444
00:16:26,128 --> 00:16:28,275
I'm a Rick!
I'm more Rick than any of you!

445
00:16:28,323 --> 00:16:30,556
Then you should know you just
killed your only leverage!

446
00:16:30,603 --> 00:16:32,346
Then comes and get me,
mother[Bleep]

447
00:16:36,373 --> 00:16:39,776
Stop.
I'm Rick D. Sanchez the Third,

448
00:16:39,831 --> 00:16:41,697
owner of this here
wafer establishment,

449
00:16:41,745 --> 00:16:43,845
and I say that the Rick in there
is right.

450
00:16:43,893 --> 00:16:45,431
He's more Rick
than any of you.

451
00:16:45,479 --> 00:16:46,486
He's a terrorist!

452
00:16:46,534 --> 00:16:47,681
What Rick isn't?!

453
00:16:47,729 --> 00:16:49,341
This Citadel
was founded by Ricks

454
00:16:49,388 --> 00:16:50,823
for Ricks to be free!

455
00:16:50,901 --> 00:16:52,252
What's your name,
young man?

456
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,535
Rick. And I'm... The
same age as me, I know.

457
00:16:54,582 --> 00:16:56,715
How long have you worked here?
15 years.

458
00:16:56,762 --> 00:16:58,338
What the hell
have we become?

459
00:16:58,385 --> 00:17:00,004
Whatever time
you were gonna make him serve,

460
00:17:00,051 --> 00:17:01,119
he's served it.

461
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:02,182
It ends now.

462
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,996
- Come with me, friend.
- Where are we going?

463
00:17:04,044 --> 00:17:05,151
To your new life.

464
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,807
Which starts with walking
the [Bleep] out of here.

465
00:17:07,855 --> 00:17:09,315
Yo J-22, give 'em hell!

466
00:17:11,969 --> 00:17:14,273
There's a Rick
that held a factory hostage

467
00:17:14,321 --> 00:17:17,000
after murdering his boss
and several coworkers.

468
00:17:17,188 --> 00:17:20,844
The factory made cookies,
flavored them with lies.

469
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,194
He made us all take a look
at what we were doing.

470
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:26,125
And in the bargain,
he got a taste of real freedom.

471
00:17:27,858 --> 00:17:29,305
We captured that taste,

472
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,797
and we keep giving it to him

473
00:17:30,891 --> 00:17:32,633
so he give it
right back to you,

474
00:17:32,735 --> 00:17:33,796
in every bite of new.

475
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,977
Simple Rick
Freedom Wafer Selects.

476
00:17:36,149 --> 00:17:38,055
Come home to the unique flavor

477
00:17:38,133 --> 00:17:40,292
of shattering
the grand illusion.

478
00:17:40,469 --> 00:17:42,774
Come home to Simple Rick.

479
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,258
It is real.

480
00:17:46,802 --> 00:17:48,168
After you.

481
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:56,493
There it is.
The Wishing Portal.

482
00:17:56,758 --> 00:17:58,547
They say for your wish
to come true,

483
00:17:58,633 --> 00:18:01,344
you have to give up something
really important.

484
00:18:01,774 --> 00:18:04,016
For me,
that's my panini maker.

485
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:06,430
I wish for
a million sandwiches.

486
00:18:06,563 --> 00:18:08,375
And, yes,
I see the irony.

487
00:18:08,563 --> 00:18:10,093
I guess
I wish I had something cooler

488
00:18:10,141 --> 00:18:12,079
than this dumb-ass
surfer necklace.

489
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:13,921
I wish incest porn had...

490
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:15,813
Had a more mainstream
appeal.

491
00:18:15,898 --> 00:18:17,219
For...
For a friend of mine.

492
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:19,331
None of those things
are gonna happen, you know.

493
00:18:19,602 --> 00:18:21,454
Morty wishes
never come true.

494
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,823
Not on the Citadel.

495
00:18:22,961 --> 00:18:24,477
Then why did you
bring us here?

496
00:18:24,547 --> 00:18:26,125
Because I wish
that would change.

497
00:18:26,219 --> 00:18:28,227
I wish anything about this life
would change.

498
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:29,673
Well, I hope you're
putting something

499
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,649
pretty God damn important
in there.

500
00:18:31,816 --> 00:18:32,959
Me too.

501
00:18:33,311 --> 00:18:34,677
But I doubt it.

502
00:18:35,016 --> 00:18:36,938
- No!
- Slick!

503
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,339
M... maybe...

504
00:18:40,493 --> 00:18:42,149
maybe it went
somewhere nice.

505
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:43,555
<i>Garbage dump.</i>

506
00:18:43,657 --> 00:18:45,860
<i>Stand back.</i>

507
00:18:50,197 --> 00:18:51,652
He had to be stopped.

508
00:18:51,699 --> 00:18:53,832
He... he cou... he c...
Couldn't be allowed to win.

509
00:18:53,879 --> 00:18:55,801
Then you should've
worked on your aim, bro.

510
00:18:55,848 --> 00:18:58,236
He's alive? No, no, no.
You gotta listen to me.

511
00:18:58,283 --> 00:19:00,563
I-I worked for him.
I was his campaign manager.

512
00:19:00,619 --> 00:19:02,532
That Morty
is not what he seems.

513
00:19:02,613 --> 00:19:05,214
Yeah, well, no Morty
seems like a president.

514
00:19:05,324 --> 00:19:07,353
- He... won?
- Yeah.

515
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,407
It was a blow out.

516
00:19:09,497 --> 00:19:11,220
I would hardly call it
a blow out.

517
00:19:11,321 --> 00:19:13,141
It was almost close enough
to trigger a recount.

518
00:19:13,188 --> 00:19:15,587
Jesus. What are you
joke security now too?

519
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:17,657
Why am I still here?

520
00:19:17,705 --> 00:19:19,156
I heard he confessed
to everything.

521
00:19:19,204 --> 00:19:21,157
Your case has been reviewed.
You're free to go.

522
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,262
But... I violated at least
a dozen departmental codes.

523
00:19:24,321 --> 00:19:26,243
New department.
New codes.

524
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:27,654
New Citadel.

525
00:19:27,701 --> 00:19:29,773
Did we miss graduation?

526
00:19:29,821 --> 00:19:30,953
Where are the new Ricks?

527
00:19:31,001 --> 00:19:32,767
No graduation.
No new Ricks.

528
00:19:32,815 --> 00:19:34,976
- The school's curriculum is changing.
- To what?

529
00:19:35,024 --> 00:19:36,579
I don't know,
and I don't have to know.

530
00:19:36,627 --> 00:19:37,664
I've been fired.

531
00:19:37,712 --> 00:19:39,044
Good luck, turds.

532
00:19:39,091 --> 00:19:41,880
Holy crap.
Slick's wish came true.

533
00:19:43,584 --> 00:19:45,149
Sorry I'm late,
Mr. President.

534
00:19:45,197 --> 00:19:47,806
Had a little crisis at work.
Worth it!

535
00:19:47,963 --> 00:19:49,018
It's no problem.

536
00:19:49,101 --> 00:19:50,700
A little more
off the top.

537
00:19:50,748 --> 00:19:53,199
You were saying,
Garment District Rick.

538
00:19:53,356 --> 00:19:56,094
We were saying,
"President" Morty,

539
00:19:56,142 --> 00:19:57,859
that we don't care
who sits in that seat.

540
00:19:57,907 --> 00:19:59,767
A Rick, a Morty,
a god damn Jerry...

541
00:19:59,815 --> 00:20:01,641
It doesn't matter.
We've been running the Citadel

542
00:20:01,688 --> 00:20:02,875
since before the council

543
00:20:02,923 --> 00:20:04,836
and you'll find that we're
still running it now.

544
00:20:04,884 --> 00:20:06,743
Does he really speak
for everyone here?

545
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:07,695
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

546
00:20:07,743 --> 00:20:09,453
Well, I think it's important
to be clear.

547
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:11,724
Raise your hand
if he speaks for you.

548
00:20:16,483 --> 00:20:18,704
Is... that enough
off the top?

549
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,841
I don't know.
Is it?

550
00:20:20,895 --> 00:20:22,657
- Yes, yes, god damn, yes.
- I think it's great.

551
00:20:22,704 --> 00:20:24,142
Good.

552
00:20:24,243 --> 00:20:26,312
This seems like
a good time for a drink

553
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,173
and a cold calculated speech
with sinister overtones.

554
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,532
A speech about politics...

555
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:35,065
About order...

556
00:20:35,345 --> 00:20:36,782
Brotherhood...

557
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:38,254
Power.

558
00:20:38,665 --> 00:20:40,871
But speeches
are for campaigning.

559
00:20:41,329 --> 00:20:44,004
Now is the time for action.

560
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:43,467
Whoo! Yeah!

561
00:21:43,704 --> 00:21:45,943
Atlantis, baby!
That was amazing.

562
00:21:46,021 --> 00:21:47,568
You got some of that
mermaid puss.

563
00:21:47,623 --> 00:21:50,108
I'm really hoping it wasn't a one-off
thing and I can see her again.

564
00:21:50,155 --> 00:21:51,155
By the way, hey, um,

565
00:21:51,224 --> 00:21:52,459
you're still not
curious about what

566
00:21:52,506 --> 00:21:54,324
what might've happened
at that crazy Citadel place?

567
00:21:54,371 --> 00:21:55,489
Psh. Not at all, Morty.

568
00:21:55,537 --> 00:21:58,516
That place will never have
any bearing over our lives ever again.

569
00:21:58,564 --> 00:22:00,215
- Unlike that mermaid puss!
- Whoo!

570
00:22:00,263 --> 00:22:02,275
- Yeah! We're going back for seconds!
- Yeah! Yeah! Whoo!

571
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:04,004
We're gonna do that shit
every week, man!

572
00:22:04,052 --> 00:22:05,957
- That was Atlantis!
- Shit!
