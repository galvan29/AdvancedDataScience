00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:33,690
Principal vagina here

2
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:34,990
don't let the name fool you.

3
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:36,220
I'm very much in charge

4
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,450
reminding you that tonight is

5
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,020
our annual flu season dance.

6
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,250
I don't know how many times i

7
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,420
have to say this, but if you

8
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,520
have the flu, stay home.

9
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,420
Hey.

10
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,920
The flu season dance is about

11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,950
awareness, not celebration.

12
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,150
Morty: [sighs]

13
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:47,150
you don't bring dead babies

14
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:48,985
to passover.

15
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,550
Morty: okay. Here we go.

16
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,720
H-hey, Jessica.

17
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,320
Uh...

18
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,550
what's up, Morty?

19
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:55,220
[Sneezes]

20
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,220
what are you doing?

21
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,049
Morty: um...

22
00:00:57,049 --> 00:00:58,190
wait, wait.

23
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,150
Were you about to talk... to her?

24
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,850
Morty: well... I mean, I was

25
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:02,920
thinking about it.

26
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,819
Dude, stay in your league.

27
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:05,989
Look at how hot she is.

28
00:01:05,989 --> 00:01:07,250
You don't see me going to a

29
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,819
bigger school in a wealthier

30
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:09,819
district and hitting on their

31
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:10,620
prettiest girl.

32
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,790
Gee, thanks, brad.

33
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,319
I throw balls far.

34
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:14,989
You want good words?

35
00:01:14,989 --> 00:01:16,550
Date a languager.

36
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:17,720
Jerry: try not to worry about

37
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,450
it, Morty.

38
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:19,890
You're a good kid, and there's

39
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,019
not a premium on that right now,

40
00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:22,120
but you'll be getting girls

41
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,120
sometime after brad's out of

42
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:23,715
shape.

43
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,790
Morty: [sighing] you're

44
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,150
missing the point, dad.

45
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,550
I don't want girls.

46
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:28,849
I want Jessica.

47
00:01:28,849 --> 00:01:30,790
Jerry: ah, well, I remember

48
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,049
feeling that way about a young

49
00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:33,750
lady named "your mom," and

50
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,049
that's not an urban diss.

51
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:36,150
Your mom was my Jessica.

52
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:36,150
I remember the first time I saw

53
00:01:36,849 --> 00:01:37,415
her.

54
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,085
I thought

55
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,250
Rick: "i should get her

56
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,120
pregnant, and then she'll have

57
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,019
to marry me."

58
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:42,019
Jerry: I beg your pardon,

59
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:43,120
Rick inappropriate.

60
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,319
Rick: sorry, please proceed

61
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,420
with your story about banging my

62
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,750
daughter in high school.

63
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:47,890
I'm not sure you want to take

64
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:48,650
romantic advice from this guy,

65
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,390
Morty.

66
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,390
His marriage is hanging from a

67
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,090
thread.

68
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:51,090
Jerry: my marriage is fine,

69
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:52,784
thank you.

70
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:53,950
Rick: Jerry, it's your

71
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,150
house whatever you say it is

72
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,319
is how it is but I think a

73
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,390
blind man could see that Beth is

74
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,489
looking for the door.

75
00:01:58,489 --> 00:01:59,790
I barely have a reason to care,

76
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,650
and even inoticed.

77
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:01,790
Morty: come on, Rick!

78
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,590
Don't talk about my parents like

79
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,319
that.

80
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,420
Rick: listen, Morty, I hate

81
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,720
to break it to you, but what

82
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,920
people call "love" is just a

83
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,220
chemical reaction that compels

84
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,389
animals to breed.

85
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:11,050
It hits hard, Morty, then it

86
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,520
slowly fades, leaving you

87
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,990
stranded in a failing marriage.

88
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,919
I did it.

89
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,020
Your parents are gonna do it.

90
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,120
Break the cycle, Morty.

91
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,650
Rise above. Focus on science.

92
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,990
[Slurps]

93
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,190
Morty: all right, well, I'm

94
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:22,190
gonna go get dressed for the

95
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:23,914
dance.

96
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:25,250
Jerry: yeah, I'm just going

97
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,490
to... check on your mom.

98
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,150
Rick: Morty, hand me that

99
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,819
screwdriver, huh?

100
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,949
I'm almost finished making my

101
00:02:33,949 --> 00:02:34,949
ionic defibulizer, Morty.

102
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:36,050
It's gonna be great.

103
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,289
Morty: hey, listen, Rick.

104
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:38,819
Y-y-you know how you said that,

105
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:39,990
you know, love is a chemical and

106
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,150
all that stuff from earlier?

107
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,289
Well, I was thinking, you know,

108
00:02:42,289 --> 00:02:43,849
w-w could you make some sort

109
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:45,250
of chemical thing happen inside

110
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,819
of Jessica's mind, you know, so

111
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:48,150
where she falls in love with me

112
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,449
and all that sort of thing?

113
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:50,319
You know, like, maybe make some

114
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:50,319
sort of love potion or

115
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:51,814
something?

116
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:52,690
Rick: Morty, that's such a

117
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:53,550
poor use of my time.

118
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,319
It's beneath me.

119
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,389
Hand me the screwdriver.

120
00:02:55,389 --> 00:02:56,190
Morty: you know what?

121
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,090
No, Rick!

122
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:57,090
I'm not gonna hand you the

123
00:02:57,949 --> 00:02:58,814
screwdriver.

124
00:02:58,849 --> 00:02:59,949
I-I'm not gonna hand you

125

anything ever again, Rick!

I'm always helping you with this

127
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,789
and that and the other thing.

128
00:03:03,789 --> 00:03:05,819
W-w-w-w-w-what about me, Rick?

129
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,349
W-w-w-w-why can't you just help

130
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:08,919
me out once once for once?

132
00:03:09,949 --> 00:03:11,220
you're growing up fast, Morty.

133
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,490
You're growing into a real big

134
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,789
thorn straight up into my ass.

[Clears throat]

136
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:16,289
listen, this is called oxytocin.

137
00:03:16,289 --> 00:03:17,750
I extracted it from a vole.

138
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,690
Do you know what a vole is,

139
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:19,690
Morty?

140
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:20,750
You know what a vole is?

141
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,819
It's a it's a rodent that

142
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:22,949
mates for life, Morty.

143
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:24,220
This is the chemical released in

144
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,319
a mammal's brain, you know, that

145
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,490
makes it fall in love.

146
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:27,919
All right, Morty, I just got to

147
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:28,720
[burps] combine it with some of

148
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,349
your dna.

149
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:30,250

Rick: a hair, Morty.

152
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,389
I need one of your hairs.

153
00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:34,120
This isn't "game of thrones."

154

Morty: ow!

155
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:36,990
Rick: all right, Morty.

156

Whoever you smear this stuff on

157
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:39,720
will fall in love with you, and

158
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,789
only you, forever.

159
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:41,849
Are you happy now, Morty?

160

question is that?

173

00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:22,019
It's fixed.

570
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,454
You know, we could we could

571
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,919
just enjoy it for a little bit.

572
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:26,750
I mean, l-l-l-look at how crazy

573
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,450
it is.

574
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,789
I mean, Morty, w-w-when's the

575
00:13:28,789 --> 00:13:29,789
next time you're gonna see

576
00:13:29,789 --> 00:13:30,889
something like this?

577
00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:31,990
I mean, soak it in, you know?

578
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,850
It's it's pretty neat.

579
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:33,789
It's pretty interesting.

580
00:13:33,789 --> 00:13:34,649
Morty: that's it, Rick!

581
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:35,090
I'm pulling the lever.

[Grunts]

583
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:43,490
Rick: w-what do we have here,

584
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,220
Morty?

585
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,120
Looks like I was right and you

586
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,049
were wrong, huh?

587
00:13:46,049 --> 00:13:47,120
I-i-i-i-i-i-i bet you feel

588
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,120
pretty stupid right about now,

589
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:48,785
huh?

590
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,019
I-i-i bet you feel like the

591
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:51,220
world's smallest man that you

592
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,250
were doubting me about this

593
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,389
whole thing, Morty.

594
00:13:53,389 --> 00:13:54,490
Morty: oh, Rick, something's

595
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,090
not right.

Rick: [sighs]

597
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:56,854
yeah, you.

598
00:13:56,889 --> 00:13:57,919
You're not right ever.

599
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:58,820
Morty: no, no!

600
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,019

Morty.

607
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,450
This must be the best day of

608
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,220
your life.

609
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,549

619
00:15:04,789 --> 00:15:05,889
was my penis.

620
00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:07,190
Beth: if it were, you could

621
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,889
call me ernest hemingway.

622
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:10,250

Summer: I don't know.

630
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:21,820
Do you think grandpa Rick had

631
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:22,850
something to do with this?

632
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:23,789
Jerry: it's not fair to

633
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:24,649
assume that, Summer.

634
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:25,289
Beth: oh, not fair?

635
00:15:25,289 --> 00:15:26,820
Give me a break.

cronenberged the world up,

644
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:43,815
didn't i?

645
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,090
We got a whole planet of

646
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:46,090
cronenbergs walking around down

647
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:47,090
there, Morty.

648
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,120
A-at least they're not in love

649
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,220
with you anymore, though.

650
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,019
That's a huge step in the right

651
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:50,019
direction.

652
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,905
Morty: oh, my god!

653
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,990
It's a living nightmare!

654
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,120
How could you be so

655
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,389
irresponsible, Rick?

656
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:57,049
Rick: me irresponsible?!

657
00:15:57,049 --> 00:15:58,289
You all I wanted you to do

658
00:15:58,289 --> 00:15:59,120
was hand me a screwdriver,

659
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,049
Morty!

660
00:16:00,049 --> 00:16:01,320
You're the one who wanted to

661
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,889
be wanted me to buckle down

662
00:16:02,889 --> 00:16:05,019
and make you up a... roofie-juice

663
00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:06,850
serum so you could roofie that

664
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,350
poor girl at your school.

665
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,190
I mean, g w-w-w-w-w w

666
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,389
are you kidding me, Morty?

667
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:12,350
You're gonna try to take the

668
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,419
high road on this one?

669
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:14,019
Y-y-y-y-you're a little creep,

670
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:14,019

you're you're just a little

creepy... creep person.

674
00:16:17,789 --> 00:16:18,850
Morty: all right, fine.

675
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:19,990
I should have just listened to

676
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:20,690
you when you refused to make the

677
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:21,450
serum.

678
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,720
I'm willing to accept my part of

679
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,750
the blame for this, Rick.

680
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,590
But I'll tell you something

681
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,350
you know what?

682
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,519
You got to accept your part of

683
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,320
the blame!

684
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,450
I'm not the one who fouled up

685
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,250
the serum!

686
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,490
I'm not the one who who

687
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,950
who who haphazardly, you

688
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,289
know, mixed a bunch of nonsense

689
00:16:33,289 --> 00:16:34,490
together and created a bunch of

690
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:35,250
cronenbergs!

691
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,320
You got to fix this, Rick!

692
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:36,320
Morty: all right, all right,

693
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:37,815
Morty.

694
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:38,919
You know, w-w-w-we are in a

695
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:40,289
pretty deep hole, here, but I do

696
00:16:40,289 --> 00:16:41,820
have one emergency solution that

697
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,049
i can use that'll kind of put

698
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:44,120
everything back to normal,

699
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,320
relatively speaking.

700
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,820
Here, Morty, put this on while i

701
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,620
do a little bit of scouting.

[Birds chirping]

703
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,919
Morty: wow, Rick, I got to

704
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:04,190
say you really pulled a

705
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,089
rabbit out of your hat this

706
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:06,049
time.

707
00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:07,390
I mean, i-i really thought that

708
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,950
the whole place was gonna be

709
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,319
messed up for good, but here,

710
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,819
you did it y-y-you you

711
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,119
you figured out that crazy

712
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,049
solution, like you always do.

713
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:14,049
Whoo!

714
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,070
That's some great luck.

715
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,250
Rick: come on, Morty.

716
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,450
Luck had nothing to do with it.

717
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,190
I'm great.

718
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,789
That's the real reason.

719
00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:22,720
Now, Morty, what do you say,

720
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,450
buddy?

721
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,019
Will you hand me a screwdriver

722
00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:26,089
so I can finish my ionic dis

723

724
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:28,250
Morty: sure thing, Rick.

725
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,390
Here's a screwdriver.

726
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,750
Rick: all right, Morty.

727
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,990
Thank you very much.

We got one screw turn... and two

screw turns... and...

730
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,369
all right, Morty, here we are.

731
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:43,789
Morty: oh, my god, Rick!

732
00:17:43,789 --> 00:17:44,890
Is that us?!

733
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:45,990
W-w-w-we're dead!

734
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,819
What is going on, Rick?

735
00:17:46,819 --> 00:17:47,750
I'm freaking out!

736
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,819

737
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:49,950
Look at me! Calm down, Morty!

738
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:50,690
Morty: no, I can't deal with

739
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:51,420
this!

740
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,490
Rick: calm yourself, Morty.

741
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:53,450
Morty: I can't deal with

742
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,089
this, Rick!

743
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:55,150
Rick: calm down, Morty.

744
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,220
Morty: this can't be real!

745

00:17:57,849 --> 00:17:58,450
Morty: w-w-w-w-we're ripped

748
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,190
apart!

749
00:17:59,190 --> 00:17:59,190
Rick: shut up and listen to

750
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,855
me!

751
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,220
It's fine. Everything is fine.

752
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,420
There's an infinite number of

753
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,920
realities, Morty, and in a few

754
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,089
dozen of those, I got lucky and

755
00:18:06,089 --> 00:18:06,089
turned everything back to

756
00:18:06,849 --> 00:18:07,784
normal.

757
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:08,990
I just had to find one of those

758
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,190
realities in which we also

759
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,019
happen to both die around this

760
00:18:11,019 --> 00:18:11,019
time.

761
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,420
Now we can just slip into the

762
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:14,890
place of our dead selves in this

763
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:15,849
reality and everything will be

764
00:18:15,849 --> 00:18:16,720
fine.

765
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,519
We're not skipping a beat,

766
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:18,289
Morty.

767
00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:19,289
Now, help me with these bodies.

768
00:18:19,289 --> 00:18:20,349
Morty: this is insane.

769
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,450
Rick: look, Morty, I'll grab

770
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,789
myself, you grab yourself, okay?

771
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:23,990
I mean, t-t-t-that seems fair to

772
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,049
me I mean, that seems like a

773
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:26,150
fair way to divvy it up.

774
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,190
Morty: Rick, what about the

775
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,289
reality we left behind?

776
00:18:28,289 --> 00:18:29,390
Rick: what about the reality

777
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:30,089
where hitler cured cancer,

778
00:18:30,089 --> 00:18:31,019
Morty?

779
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:31,019
The answer is don't think about

780
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,455
it.

781
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:33,690
It's not like we can do this

782
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:34,720
every week, anyways.

783
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,589
We get three or four more of

784
00:18:35,589 --> 00:18:36,390
these, tops.

785
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,420
Now, pick up your dead self and

786
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:37,420
come on.

787
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,215
Haste makes waste.

788
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,450
I-i-i don't suppose you've

789
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,849
considered this detail, but

790
00:18:41,849 --> 00:18:43,220
obviously, if I hadn't screwed

791
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,819
up as much as I did, we'd be

792
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:46,019
these guys right now, so, again,

793
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:47,549
you're welcome.

about a shark...

815
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,549
he's got lifeless eyes...

816
00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:31,549
black eyes, like a doll's eyes.

817
00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:33,250
When he comes at ya, he doesn't

818
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,950
seem to be living until he bites

819
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,420
ya, and then the the blood,

820
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,890
and the red, and the water...

821
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:39,150
Jerry: [sighs]

822
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,049
you ever wonder what happened to

823
00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:41,190
Rick and Morty?

824
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,819
Beth: sometimes.

825
00:20:42,819 --> 00:20:44,319
But, I'm ashamed to admit, now

826
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:46,619
that they're gone, I'm finally

827
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:49,390
happy.

828
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,519
Rick: here we are,

829
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:52,019
cronenberg Morty a reality

830
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:53,220
where everyone in the world got

831
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,250
genetically cronenberged.

832
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,190
We'll fit right in,

833
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,289
cronenberg Morty.

834
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:57,289
It'll be like we never even left

835
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:58,349
cronenberg world.

836
00:20:58,349 --> 00:20:59,750
Morty: yeah, cronenberg Rick,

837
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,849
but, you know, I'm gonna miss

838
00:21:00,849 --> 00:21:01,950
cronenberg world, because

839
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:02,990
everyone was cronenberged all

840
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:03,920
along like us from the

841
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,920
beginning, you know?

842
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,150
I mean, i-i wish we hadn't

843
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,420
genetically ruined cronenberg

844
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,920
world beyond repair like we did,

845
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,220
you know, and turned everyone

846
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,289
into regular, normal people just

847
00:21:11,289 --> 00:21:12,349
walking around.

848
00:21:12,349 --> 00:21:13,650
Rick: don't you worry about

849
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:14,589
that sort of thing,

850
00:21:14,589 --> 00:21:15,549
cronenberg Morty.

851
00:21:15,549 --> 00:21:16,619
Let's go make ourselves at home,

852
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:20,650
huh?
