1
00:00:01,457 --> 00:00:03,325
Don't let any of those
things get away, Morty.

2
00:00:03,373 --> 00:00:05,153
It their DNA gets
into Earth's food chain,

3
00:00:05,201 --> 00:00:06,786
our entire species
could be sterilized.

4
00:00:06,848 --> 00:00:08,135
Then why aren't we
killing them?

5
00:00:08,183 --> 00:00:10,128
Right, next time I need
a species sterilized,

6
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:11,700
who's gonna do it for me,
you?

7
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:12,801
Whoa! Rick!

8
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:14,348
I-Is that
the Vindibeacon?

9
00:00:14,396 --> 00:00:16,464
We're being called to assemble
by the Vindicators!

10
00:00:16,512 --> 00:00:18,832
I refuse to answer a literal
call to adventure, Morty.

11
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,245
- Let it go to voice mail.
- Rick,

12
00:00:20,293 --> 00:00:22,908
the Vindicators only call when
the universe itself is at stake.

13
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:24,801
They're the first line
of defense against evil.

14
00:00:24,849 --> 00:00:26,426
They're the guardians
of the unguarded!

15
00:00:26,474 --> 00:00:28,559
They're the writers of their own
press releases, Morty.

16
00:00:28,606 --> 00:00:30,730
They're a bunch of drama queens
that spend an hour talking

17
00:00:30,754 --> 00:00:32,742
and 20 minutes jumping around
while shit blows up.

18
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:33,847
They're a phase.

19
00:00:33,895 --> 00:00:36,863
We did one, it was the big even
of that summer, let it die.

20
00:00:36,927 --> 00:00:39,113
I, Morty Smith,
invoke my right

21
00:00:39,161 --> 00:00:42,229
to choose one in every 10
Rick and Morty adventures.

22
00:00:42,277 --> 00:00:43,894
God damn it!
Read 'em and weep.

23
00:00:43,956 --> 00:00:46,112
Fine. But don't say
I didn't warn you.

24
00:00:46,386 --> 00:00:49,362
Yes! Vindicator Command Ship...
Beacon received.

25
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,097
We're doing
Vindicators Twoooooo!

26
00:00:53,145 --> 00:00:54,146
Whoops.

27
00:00:54,194 --> 00:00:56,566
Uh, Morty, you might want
to freeze some sperm.

28
00:01:24,823 --> 00:01:28,839
<font color=#FF00FF>*RICKY AND MORTY*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 03 Episode 04</font>
<font color=#FFFF00>"Vindicators 3: The Return of Worldender"</font>

29
00:01:28,887 --> 00:01:30,153
Vindicators.

30
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:31,474
Worldender is back,

31
00:01:31,522 --> 00:01:34,089
and this time he's out
to end more than worlds.

32
00:01:34,191 --> 00:01:36,909
We have reason to believe
his stronghold is located on...

33
00:01:36,957 --> 00:01:37,978
- My balls.
- Rick!

34
00:01:38,026 --> 00:01:39,480
The Terraneous system.

35
00:01:39,528 --> 00:01:43,221
Once in range, Million Ants
will scan for pheromone activity

36
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,237
which should lead us
to the location of the base.

37
00:01:45,295 --> 00:01:47,292
Oh, that's Million Ants.

38
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,831
I can't see the ants
from over here,

39
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:51,338
I just assumed that was, uh,
turd man,

40
00:01:51,386 --> 00:01:52,495
wiggly turd man.

41
00:01:52,543 --> 00:01:53,561
Rick, stop! Rick.

42
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:55,361
You have something to add
to the briefing?

43
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:57,559
Uh, yeah,
just a few more design notes...

44
00:01:57,607 --> 00:02:00,557
Um, this guy,
the, uh... the, uh...

45
00:02:00,605 --> 00:02:02,323
I am Crocubot.

46
00:02:02,518 --> 00:02:03,705
Right, Crocubot.

47
00:02:03,802 --> 00:02:06,995
So, you're half cold,
unfeeling reptile, half...

48
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,331
also cold...

49
00:02:08,411 --> 00:02:10,495
equally unfeeling machine.
Yes.

50
00:02:10,573 --> 00:02:12,323
Wow. So, your origin
is what?

51
00:02:12,417 --> 00:02:14,847
Y-You fell
into a vat of redundancy?

52
00:02:15,003 --> 00:02:16,190
Got damn!

53
00:02:16,238 --> 00:02:18,193
Noob Noob,
we're having a briefing.

54
00:02:18,228 --> 00:02:19,628
If I can continue, Rick.

55
00:02:19,683 --> 00:02:22,105
I anticipate sophisticated
security measures.

56
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,878
I trust
you can be of service there.

57
00:02:23,926 --> 00:02:26,120
Well, let me check my list
of powers and weaknesses.

58
00:02:26,263 --> 00:02:28,885
Ability to do anything...
But only whenever I want...

59
00:02:28,933 --> 00:02:30,417
Yeah, that sounds like
a job for me.

60
00:02:30,472 --> 00:02:32,948
I wish he had the ability
to check his attitude.

61
00:02:33,002 --> 00:02:34,378
Alan Rails,
ladies and gentlemen.

62
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:36,647
After his parents tragic death
in a railroad accident,

63
00:02:36,695 --> 00:02:38,580
he gained the power
to summon ghost trains.

64
00:02:38,615 --> 00:02:39,847
It's not all bad though,

65
00:02:39,895 --> 00:02:42,909
they were spared having to see
their grown son wear a WHISTLE.

66
00:02:42,964 --> 00:02:44,652
Got damn!

67
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,823
Thanks, Noob Noob.
This guy gets it.

68
00:02:49,578 --> 00:02:52,445
Vance Maximus,
Renegade Star Soldier...

69
00:02:53,026 --> 00:02:55,070
Sorry I'm late.
It was happy hour.

70
00:02:56,179 --> 00:02:57,259
Happy hour.

71
00:02:57,307 --> 00:02:59,451
Uh, I was also late
because of my drinking

72
00:02:59,499 --> 00:03:01,171
and mentioned it
to zero applause.

73
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:03,507
Rick Sanchez.
Tinkerer of Terror.

74
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,772
Man, that's hard to say.

75
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,577
And... Morty, right?

76
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:08,655
- Whoa, yeah!
- I never forget a kid.

77
00:03:08,703 --> 00:03:11,065
What do you say, Vindicators,
let's make this three for three?

78
00:03:11,112 --> 00:03:12,218
- Haha! Aah!
- Yes!

79
00:03:12,266 --> 00:03:13,698
Did he say
"three for three"?

80
00:03:13,746 --> 00:03:15,515
Did he say he never
forgets a kid?

81
00:03:15,563 --> 00:03:17,952
You mean two for two,
right, Vance?

82
00:03:19,322 --> 00:03:23,171
Actually, we assembled
a second time last summer

83
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:25,101
to fight Doomnomitron.

84
00:03:25,335 --> 00:03:27,812
So this is...
Vindicators Three?

85
00:03:27,913 --> 00:03:32,567
And you guys did
Vindicators Two... without us?

86
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,632
I sense... insecurity.

87
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,163
Are you sure there's not
just a picnic nearby?

88
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,585
I guess he found his crowd.

89
00:03:40,697 --> 00:03:42,570
Pretty toothless stuff,
guys.

90
00:03:45,469 --> 00:03:47,807
I hope you're happy with
the adventure so far, Morty.

91
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:49,557
These guys are even lamer
than last time.

92
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:51,860
We weren't here last time,
remember?

93
00:03:51,908 --> 00:03:53,781
They did a whole Vindicators
without us.

94
00:03:53,851 --> 00:03:55,421
A bunch of them got killed,
too.

95
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:58,944
They lost Lady Katana,
Calypso, Diablo Verde...

96
00:03:58,992 --> 00:04:01,945
Yikes. Yeah, things did feel
less diverse in there.

97
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:04,625
This article says the reason
we weren't involved was...

98
00:04:04,694 --> 00:04:06,406
"personality conflicts."

99
00:04:06,516 --> 00:04:08,453
Don't worry, Morty,
they love you.

100
00:04:08,563 --> 00:04:10,378
Superheroes need
a wide-eyed unremarkable

101
00:04:10,413 --> 00:04:12,086
to tag along and react
to everything

102
00:04:12,134 --> 00:04:13,155
like it's mind blowing.

103
00:04:13,203 --> 00:04:16,484
I... think the personality
conflict might have been...

104
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,697
you?

105
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,421
Jesus...

106
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,047
How awesome is that?

107
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,757
I mean, they wanted
to not need me so bad

108
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,526
they murdered three
innocent heroes of color

109
00:04:25,561 --> 00:04:27,047
and they still
had to bring me back?

110
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,125
Rick, since
it's my adventure and all,

111
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,649
could you do me a favor?

112
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:33,033
Uh, the adventure
is the favor, Morty.

113
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,274
Me sleeping on these linens
is the favor.

114
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,953
I mean, w-w-what... what are we
vindicating? Comfort?

115
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,649
Rick,
this really bums me out.

116
00:04:39,697 --> 00:04:42,235
It-It's embarrassing to find out
these guys don't like us.

117
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:44,437
Why? Morty
I defeat gagoos

118
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:46,265
more powerful than these guys
every week.

119
00:04:46,313 --> 00:04:47,828
Yeah, but not heroes.

120
00:04:47,876 --> 00:04:50,265
Oh, please, they just call
themselves heroes so they can...

121
00:04:50,313 --> 00:04:54,203
I'm calling them that, Rick!
They're my heroes. Mine!

122
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,885
Huh, no accounting
for taste.

123
00:04:59,055 --> 00:05:00,617
I'm gonna go get a drink.

124
00:05:08,688 --> 00:05:09,985
<i>Good morning, Vindicators.</i>

125
00:05:10,117 --> 00:05:12,305
<i>Ship has arrived
at Terraneous system.</i>

126
00:05:12,461 --> 00:05:15,810
<i>All Vindicators report
to the... briefing room.</i>

127
00:05:15,969 --> 00:05:17,805
<i>The... The room
from the, uh... the...</i>

128
00:05:17,999 --> 00:05:20,235
<i>Uh, it's the d...
It's a different room than...</i>

129
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,945
<i>Than conference room.</i>

130
00:05:22,172 --> 00:05:24,524
<i>I'm sorry, it's my first day
as a PA System.</i>

131
00:05:24,735 --> 00:05:26,250
<i>First-day jitters.</i>

132
00:05:29,336 --> 00:05:30,485
Oh, God.

133
00:05:30,571 --> 00:05:33,422
Good morning. Looks like your
grandpa had a long night.

134
00:05:33,524 --> 00:05:36,116
Crocubot, why don't you
escort Mr. Sanchez

135
00:05:36,164 --> 00:05:39,305
to a more comfortable spot
so that someone can...

136
00:05:40,156 --> 00:05:41,813
clean up his diarrhea.

137
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,608
Oooh, I'm nervous
about my first mission!

138
00:05:44,656 --> 00:05:47,016
Actually, Noob Noob,
you have a new mission.

139
00:05:47,227 --> 00:05:50,813
Got... damn. Vindicators,
prepare for arrival.

140
00:05:51,034 --> 00:05:53,647
Morty, the Vindicators and
I had a chat this morning,

141
00:05:53,695 --> 00:05:55,633
and I'm afraid we need
to make a little change.

142
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,650
Aah! I-I totally get it.
I-I'm so sorry.

143
00:05:58,698 --> 00:05:59,897
You should be.

144
00:06:00,013 --> 00:06:01,382
Running around
in a yellow T-shirt

145
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,578
like you're not one of us.

146
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,916
- Disgraceful.
- I-I... I'm not a superhero.

147
00:06:05,964 --> 00:06:07,049
Cop a squat, chief.

148
00:06:07,097 --> 00:06:08,863
Everyone in the universe
is a hero.

149
00:06:08,898 --> 00:06:11,245
All you have to do is know the
difference between good and bad,

150
00:06:11,292 --> 00:06:12,330
and root for good.

151
00:06:12,378 --> 00:06:14,802
Rick says good and bad
are artificial constructs.

152
00:06:14,837 --> 00:06:16,759
Yeah, well,
I get the feeling...

153
00:06:17,337 --> 00:06:19,235
He kind of needs that
to be the case.

154
00:06:19,307 --> 00:06:20,696
Not coming, Noob Noob?

155
00:06:21,345 --> 00:06:25,540
Ohh! No, uh,
I got stuff to do here.

156
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:34,095
Security drones, inbound.

157
00:06:34,246 --> 00:06:37,080
Star Mother,
grant me your wrath.

158
00:06:40,365 --> 00:06:41,732
All aboard!

159
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,589
- Gun turret.
- Are you all right?

160
00:06:56,637 --> 00:06:58,963
Yes. I only lost 400 ants.

161
00:06:59,011 --> 00:07:00,574
My queen is laying more.

162
00:07:00,871 --> 00:07:03,691
I am back to...
one Million Ants.

163
00:07:03,769 --> 00:07:05,800
Someone wake up Sanchez.

164
00:07:07,331 --> 00:07:08,923
Ugh! Oh, Christ.

165
00:07:08,988 --> 00:07:10,724
- Rick. You're up.
- Barely.

166
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,588
We're taking fire
from an automated turret.

167
00:07:12,636 --> 00:07:14,683
- Can you bring it offline?
- Uh-huh.

168
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:25,739
- Uh, my God, that's better.
- Rick!

169
00:07:25,816 --> 00:07:27,831
Hey, I can't help
if I can't see.

170
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:49,029
I could've just used
a ghost train.

171
00:07:49,121 --> 00:07:51,732
Really? You don't say.
You would've used a ghost train?

172
00:07:51,863 --> 00:07:53,972
Hey, everybody,
the ghost train guy

173
00:07:54,058 --> 00:07:55,836
would have used
a ghost train.

174
00:07:55,871 --> 00:07:57,671
- Man, you.
- Is there coffee?

175
00:07:57,707 --> 00:07:58,847
Hey, Morty,
can you be a pal,

176
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,612
Grandpa left his coffee maker
on the ship,

177
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,034
you know,
the French press thing...

178
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:03,214
Get it yourself.

179
00:08:06,568 --> 00:08:08,920
Little extra snippy
this morning, aren't you?

180
00:08:08,982 --> 00:08:10,684
Just focus on the mission,
all right?

181
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,701
Oh-oh-oh, I'm sorry,
oh, you're right.

182
00:08:12,787 --> 00:08:16,092
Ohh, real serious.
Gotta take it real serious, huh?

183
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,146
Son of a Steam Engine.
They're all dead.

184
00:08:20,263 --> 00:08:23,084
Why would Worldender do this
to his own men...

185
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,666
- and several women?
- Well, he is the Worldender.

186
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,795
The guy ends worlds.
Kind of his thing.

187
00:08:27,951 --> 00:08:31,099
- Ohh, real scared.
- Real on alert,

188
00:08:31,154 --> 00:08:32,490
high alert over here.

189
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:35,037
Watch out!

190
00:08:35,197 --> 00:08:36,224
What the?!

191
00:08:36,272 --> 00:08:38,888
It's Worldender!
What happened to him?

192
00:08:39,922 --> 00:08:42,188
I sense his life force
is fading.

193
00:08:42,236 --> 00:08:43,740
Million Ants,
ladies and gentlemen.

194
00:08:43,788 --> 00:08:46,717
The ant colony with the power
of two human eyes.

195
00:08:48,263 --> 00:08:50,451
All right. Short mission.
Good mission.

196
00:08:50,513 --> 00:08:52,552
Remember when Alan
wanted to use a ghost train?

197
00:08:52,662 --> 00:08:55,732
See you guys in Vindicators Four.
Morty? Rick, whoever did this

198
00:08:55,787 --> 00:08:57,677
is an even bigger threat
than Worldender.

199
00:08:57,732 --> 00:08:58,732
We can't leave now.

200
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:01,084
He's right.
This is far from over.

201
00:09:01,132 --> 00:09:02,146
Well, have fun with that,

202
00:09:02,194 --> 00:09:04,623
but Morty and I have to meet
a Lady Comet, a Monorail Man,

203
00:09:04,671 --> 00:09:07,474
Two Assholes, and a
Full Alligator in like an hour.

204
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,208
Shit.

205
00:09:21,256 --> 00:09:22,748
I sense the presence

206
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:24,201
of a greater evil.

207
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:27,717
Check, check. One, two.

208
00:09:27,966 --> 00:09:30,599
Okay. Is it recording?
Good.

209
00:09:31,013 --> 00:09:32,306
Hello, Vindicators.

210
00:09:32,427 --> 00:09:35,263
Welcome to your reckoning,
baby!

211
00:09:35,834 --> 00:09:37,357
Well. It's Official.

212
00:09:37,412 --> 00:09:39,717
I had too much to drink
last night.

213
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,237
If you guys
are watching this,

214
00:09:42,323 --> 00:09:44,861
You're, you know,
the Vindicators.

215
00:09:44,924 --> 00:09:47,837
- So, now that we know...
- Rick? What's going on, buddy?

216
00:09:47,885 --> 00:09:51,048
Obviously, I came here
last night during a blackout.

217
00:09:51,096 --> 00:09:52,252
"Obviously?"

218
00:09:52,356 --> 00:09:54,666
You came here and defeated
our arch nemesis...

219
00:09:54,744 --> 00:09:56,783
while so drunk
you don't remember doing it?

220
00:09:56,893 --> 00:09:59,049
That's something "obvious"
to you?

221
00:09:59,104 --> 00:10:01,228
Look, I'm a lit... little
more complex than you guys,

222
00:10:01,276 --> 00:10:03,025
and, no offense,
but I've always suspected

223
00:10:03,073 --> 00:10:04,540
that a lot of what you do
in a year

224
00:10:04,588 --> 00:10:06,002
could be knocked out
in a couple of hours.

225
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:08,369
So I thought, why not
just do your job for you,

226
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:10,588
so we can have
a little fun game.

227
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:14,549
Rick, is...
is this a "Saw" thing?

228
00:10:14,621 --> 00:10:17,260
Are you seriously
Sawing the Vindicators?

229
00:10:17,323 --> 00:10:19,057
Morty, I'm a drunk,
not a hack.

230
00:10:19,128 --> 00:10:21,760
If you break the rules,
lose the game or try to leave,

231
00:10:21,828 --> 00:10:22,963
you will die.

232
00:10:23,018 --> 00:10:25,283
Like in "Sawwww."

233
00:10:25,331 --> 00:10:26,782
Well,
I-I-I think we've seen enough,

234
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:27,900
I'll just figure out
how to unplug this.

235
00:10:27,947 --> 00:10:29,416
Okay, here we go.
Room number one.

236
00:10:29,464 --> 00:10:31,459
The Vindicators are known
throughout the galaxy,

237
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:34,416
but do they know yourselves,
do you know yourselves?

238
00:10:34,526 --> 00:10:36,815
Match your... your shit,
your... your gimmicks,

239
00:10:36,888 --> 00:10:40,470
with your faces, and y-you get
it, it's a matching thing.

240
00:10:40,518 --> 00:10:44,018
And do it in three minutes
or you'll all die.

241
00:10:45,281 --> 00:10:46,884
Screw this.
I'm not playing his game.

242
00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:48,352
I'm gonna find us
a way out of here.

243
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,690
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, Vance.

244
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:51,227
He said you'd die
if you tried to leave.

245
00:10:51,274 --> 00:10:52,477
That means
there's booby traps.

246
00:10:52,525 --> 00:10:55,017
Why are you acting
like that's not you?

247
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,992
What part of "blackout"
don't you understand?

248
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,047
I thought you drank.

249
00:10:58,095 --> 00:11:00,415
Like cool drinking!
Like sexy drinking,

250
00:11:00,463 --> 00:11:02,663
not this psycho,
trailer-park shit!

251
00:11:02,739 --> 00:11:04,204
Vance, stay calm...

252
00:11:04,252 --> 00:11:06,477
Oh, so you're the leader now,
because we gave you a jacket?

253
00:11:06,524 --> 00:11:08,869
You're the learning-disabled kid
we do photo ops with.

254
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:10,798
Okay, ouch, but...
Okay, this...

255
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,714
This is triggering me.
I need space.

256
00:11:13,985 --> 00:11:17,048
I-I need space from this!

257
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,923
Give me one reason

258
00:11:41,972 --> 00:11:43,315
why I shouldn't crush
your windpipe.

259
00:11:43,362 --> 00:11:46,681
Because my epidermis is laced
with a nanofiber defense mesh...

260
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:49,383
And because, like I said,
I don't remember last night.

261
00:11:49,431 --> 00:11:51,821
I told you not to invite this
mummified mother back.

262
00:11:51,869 --> 00:11:53,291
Alan, I'm not proud
of what's happening here,

263
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:54,235
but if you
keep coming at me,

264
00:11:54,283 --> 00:11:56,899
there's gonna be another
passenger on that ghost train.

265
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:59,660
Guys! I figured it out.

266
00:11:59,868 --> 00:12:02,048
- Congrats!
- You did it it!

267
00:12:02,587 --> 00:12:05,649
It was a bit. All of the
descriptors apply to all of you.

268
00:12:05,697 --> 00:12:06,735
Drunk Rick's point

269
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:09,095
is that none of you
are very special or different.

270
00:12:09,243 --> 00:12:10,673
That's always his point.

271
00:12:10,775 --> 00:12:13,102
Let's just get through this
as quickly as possible.

272
00:12:13,188 --> 00:12:14,875
Then we'll deal
with the two of you.

273
00:12:14,923 --> 00:12:17,595
The two of us?
I hope you're proud of yourself.

274
00:12:17,643 --> 00:12:20,281
Uh, I kind of am. I saved
the God damn universe.

275
00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:21,617
That's not the issue,
Rick!

276
00:12:21,665 --> 00:12:23,415
Ahh, it would've been
if I hadn't!

277
00:12:23,749 --> 00:12:25,328
The Vindicators say their job

278
00:12:25,376 --> 00:12:27,423
is to fight evil
wherever it hides,

279
00:12:27,548 --> 00:12:30,313
but they don't...
Pick the location you'll...

280
00:12:30,556 --> 00:12:32,931
You'll never hear them
even mention,

281
00:12:33,007 --> 00:12:35,991
because to fight darkness
is to fight yourself.

282
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:38,248
Oh! I know this.
Dorian 5!

283
00:12:38,319 --> 00:12:39,458
Crocubot, don't!

284
00:12:39,506 --> 00:12:41,037
There's no other
possible answer.

285
00:12:41,085 --> 00:12:44,155
My mechanical and reptilian
logic are certain of it.

286
00:12:45,405 --> 00:12:46,532
Oh!

287
00:12:46,598 --> 00:12:48,819
Huh! I'm seeing more croc
than bot here.

288
00:12:48,867 --> 00:12:49,905
God damn it!

289
00:12:49,953 --> 00:12:52,491
- Uh, what happened on Dorian 5?
- Nothing!

290
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,821
Nothing? We exterminated
a planet.

291
00:12:55,869 --> 00:12:57,009
W-Wait. Huh?

292
00:12:57,065 --> 00:13:00,231
Doomnomitron was hiding there!
He's a shapeshifter.

293
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,090
Destroying Dorian 5
was the only way to kill him.

294
00:13:03,177 --> 00:13:04,658
Come on, guys,
we're all thinking it.

295
00:13:04,694 --> 00:13:05,860
Don't...

296
00:13:05,895 --> 00:13:06,895
Don't make me say it.

297
00:13:06,951 --> 00:13:08,973
Oh, okay.
This again.

298
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:10,732
You know,
I could have made you a device

299
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,489
to detect Doomnomitron from
orbit like that.

300
00:13:13,537 --> 00:13:16,372
I'm not the one that
didn't want you back. Alan was.

301
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,935
If you lay those deaths
at my doorstep one more time...

302
00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:22,216
Do not threaten her.

303
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:24,506
Congrats, you did it.

304
00:13:24,701 --> 00:13:26,287
What the hell
is "Israel"?

305
00:13:26,401 --> 00:13:28,217
It-It's just something
Rick starts talking about

306
00:13:28,264 --> 00:13:29,506
when he's blackout drunk.

307
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:31,403
W-What?
In w... In w-w-what?

308
00:13:31,451 --> 00:13:32,953
Like,
w-w-what's my point?

309
00:13:32,989 --> 00:13:34,099
In a way
that has no point,

310
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,382
you just babble about defense
budgets and the United Nations

311
00:13:36,429 --> 00:13:37,528
and then you pass out.

312
00:13:37,576 --> 00:13:40,045
So, to be clear,
I sometimes reference

313
00:13:40,185 --> 00:13:43,029
the geopolitical complexities
of the topic...

314
00:13:43,132 --> 00:13:45,466
Which is not the same as going
to an anti-Semitic place.

315
00:13:45,514 --> 00:13:46,755
I have not stake
in this...

316
00:13:46,803 --> 00:13:48,912
I don't either, I'm...
I'm just saying, if anything,

317
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,280
the drunk version of me is
probably so supportive of Israel

318
00:13:51,327 --> 00:13:52,646
he wants what's best for it
and...

319
00:13:52,693 --> 00:13:56,010
- Hey, man, I'm not touching this.
- You do you.

320
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:01,870
Aloha... means hello
and goodbye in Hawaii.

321
00:14:01,989 --> 00:14:05,286
But, uh, aloha means...

322
00:14:05,321 --> 00:14:07,223
Has nothing to do
with this room.

323
00:14:07,442 --> 00:14:09,723
I'm so drunk.

324
00:14:09,868 --> 00:14:11,566
Ugh, okay.
Here's the deal.

325
00:14:11,614 --> 00:14:13,330
I-I want to rest my eyes
for a little bit,

326
00:14:13,378 --> 00:14:14,431
I'm...
I'm not going to sleep,

327
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,197
I just... just need
to rest my eyes,

328
00:14:16,232 --> 00:14:17,916
so let's make this one
simple...

329
00:14:17,964 --> 00:14:20,065
Just... try to hit
some three pointers.

330
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,776
Let's say... you have to
hit... five three pointers

331
00:14:22,824 --> 00:14:25,018
in... five minutes... or...
I don't know,

332
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,211
the whole place... the
whole planet will get blown up

333
00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:28,769
with a n-neutrino bomb.

334
00:14:28,838 --> 00:14:30,838
And try to make it a-a lesson
about... yourselves,

335
00:14:30,886 --> 00:14:32,745
like... like
how selfish you are...

336
00:14:32,823 --> 00:14:34,049
Are or something.

337
00:14:34,182 --> 00:14:35,651
And also Hawaii.

338
00:14:35,752 --> 00:14:37,315
You guys hit the baskets,

339
00:14:37,386 --> 00:14:39,955
I'll disarm the
drunkenly-improvised neutrino bomb.

340
00:14:40,022 --> 00:14:41,651
There's a 40 percent chance
it's a dud,

341
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:43,556
but... y-you should still
stay back.

342
00:14:43,604 --> 00:14:44,713
Morty, how many of these...

343
00:14:44,761 --> 00:14:46,721
Too many, Rick! Too many!

344
00:14:46,971 --> 00:14:49,830
Man, I am really getting
high-roaded today.

345
00:14:52,885 --> 00:14:54,201
That's a three pointer.

346
00:14:54,237 --> 00:14:55,936
- Nice shot.
- Thank you.

347
00:14:55,972 --> 00:14:57,673
You two
make quite a team.

348
00:14:57,827 --> 00:14:59,726
Aah! We all do.

349
00:14:59,931 --> 00:15:01,123
Yeah, I guess...

350
00:15:01,205 --> 00:15:02,409
That's a three pointer.

351
00:15:02,445 --> 00:15:06,525
But you guys have always had
a... an unspoken bond.

352
00:15:07,369 --> 00:15:09,416
I mean, really unspoken.

353
00:15:09,517 --> 00:15:13,165
Like, let's-not-tell-my-husband
unspoken.

354
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,758
We aren't married anymore,
Alan.

355
00:15:17,837 --> 00:15:19,664
Sure, but were we married

356
00:15:19,712 --> 00:15:23,611
when you two were "stranded"
on Delphi Six for three days?

357
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,033
Because I sensed something
was weird when you came back...

358
00:15:28,087 --> 00:15:30,603
But what do I know
about sensitivity?

359
00:15:30,651 --> 00:15:32,499
I'm just
a phantom train conductor.

360
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:36,241
You're the pile of ordinary bugs
that my wife!

361
00:15:36,662 --> 00:15:38,145
That's a three pointer.

362
00:15:38,193 --> 00:15:39,418
Where the
is the lead wire?

363
00:15:39,466 --> 00:15:40,803
You always put it
in the weirdest place.

364
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,325
Um, uh,
over here maybe?

365
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,293
Jesus Christ,
what a shitty neutrino bomb.

366
00:15:44,353 --> 00:15:46,234
It's a miracle I ever
actually destroy anything.

367
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:49,106
Oh, I don't know, you managed
to destroy just about everything today.

368
00:15:49,154 --> 00:15:50,364
The villains, the heroes,

369
00:15:50,412 --> 00:15:52,091
the lines between them,
my childhood...

370
00:15:52,164 --> 00:15:54,422
Thank yeewwwwww.
I appreciate it, Morty,

371
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,642
I know you were sucking
the Kool-Aid

372
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:56,626
out of
the Vindicators'

373
00:15:56,674 --> 00:15:58,123
So the fact that I was right
about them

374
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,512
must be pretty hard
to admit.

375
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,168
Yeah, it is.
You know why, Rick?

376
00:16:01,237 --> 00:16:02,469
Because
when you're an asshole,

377
00:16:02,505 --> 00:16:03,865
it doesn't matter
how right you are,

378
00:16:03,912 --> 00:16:05,684
nobody wants to give you
the satisfaction.

379
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:07,899
I know. Everyone wants people
they like to be right.

380
00:16:07,974 --> 00:16:09,981
That's why popular people
are dumb.

381
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,723
And why your pretentious,
poorly-written,

382
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:12,996
high-budget friends
back there

383
00:16:13,044 --> 00:16:14,989
can eat a double-decker
shit sandwich.

384
00:16:15,051 --> 00:16:16,170
Disarmed.

385
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,348
Holy shit.
You're jealous.

386
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,613
Yes! Is that
what you want to hear?!

387
00:16:20,661 --> 00:16:21,956
Did it feel good?

388
00:16:22,012 --> 00:16:24,637
Did you like his six million
wriggling legs

389
00:16:24,707 --> 00:16:26,535
more than
my tragedy-stricken,

390
00:16:26,606 --> 00:16:29,777
- half-ghost, half-tumescent penis?!
- Guys, stop!

391
00:16:29,825 --> 00:16:31,887
You're just proving
my asshole grandpa right!

392
00:16:31,935 --> 00:16:34,910
You wish this was about sex!
We loved each other!

393
00:16:35,104 --> 00:16:37,309
- We had a child together!
- What?!

394
00:16:37,457 --> 00:16:41,175
I conceived a child with Million
Ants and it died inside me

395
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:45,590
because it was half a million
ants and half collapsing star!

396
00:16:45,731 --> 00:16:48,832
And yes.
He was better than you.

397
00:16:48,887 --> 00:16:49,942
Yeah?

398
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,989
One... million...
times... better.

399
00:16:52,037 --> 00:16:54,926
All aboard, mother

400
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:57,231
Stop!

401
00:17:00,223 --> 00:17:02,029
Oof!
Didn't see that coming.

402
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:03,285
Is that sarcasm?

403
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,433
I don't want you slipping away
when this is over.

404
00:17:05,481 --> 00:17:07,387
All of these deaths
are on your hands.

405
00:17:07,435 --> 00:17:08,934
Okay, come on,
maybe a couple of them,

406
00:17:08,982 --> 00:17:10,362
but definitely
not the Train Guy.

407
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:11,527
Oof! All of them.

408
00:17:11,575 --> 00:17:13,043
Oookay.

409
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,205
Congrats. You did it.

410
00:17:17,377 --> 00:17:18,985
All right, by now,
I've been pretty clear

411
00:17:19,033 --> 00:17:21,215
that I think the Vindicators
are full of shit.

412
00:17:21,283 --> 00:17:24,025
But... you do have one thing
that I'll never have.

413
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:26,259
And that thing is the only part
of the Vindicators

414
00:17:26,307 --> 00:17:27,579
with any value to me.

415
00:17:27,627 --> 00:17:30,080
If you know what it is,
place it on the platform.

416
00:17:30,213 --> 00:17:32,759
Guess wrong
and pla-planet will explode.

417
00:17:32,807 --> 00:17:34,236
And probably the solar system,

418
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,424
'cause I kind of
eyeballed the neutrino bombs

419
00:17:36,486 --> 00:17:37,531
on this one.

420
00:17:37,566 --> 00:17:41,168
So what's the trick? Morty,
you're the Drunk Rick expert.

421
00:17:41,596 --> 00:17:45,143
I think... no matter
what we put on there, we die.

422
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:47,650
He said it's the part
of the Vindicators he values.

423
00:17:47,738 --> 00:17:48,804
That means nothing.

424
00:17:48,852 --> 00:17:50,104
He wants
our last moment alive

425
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,863
to be spent knowing
how few he gave.

426
00:17:51,948 --> 00:17:54,565
Jesus! Okay,
open to second opinions.

427
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,150
It could...
It could be Morty.

428
00:17:56,185 --> 00:17:57,533
What?
Hey, I don't know.

429
00:17:57,604 --> 00:17:59,143
I mean, look,
when I get drunk,

430
00:17:59,213 --> 00:18:01,416
I get stupid and emotional
and there's no logic to it.

431
00:18:01,464 --> 00:18:03,649
It's, like,
it's possible I got so drunk

432
00:18:03,697 --> 00:18:05,768
I felt like I was losing Morty
to the Vindicators,

433
00:18:05,816 --> 00:18:08,369
and maybe this is
my way of saying, "Okay",

434
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:10,813
you can have him but only if
you know how important he is,

435
00:18:10,861 --> 00:18:12,065
"otherwise I'll kill you."

436
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:14,601
That is a...
really specific guess.

437
00:18:14,697 --> 00:18:17,244
Look, I-I... there's
nothing in the room but us.

438
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:19,206
I'm just using logic
to connect some dots,

439
00:18:19,241 --> 00:18:20,507
it's the best guess
I've got.

440
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:22,759
But you're betting our lives
on it.

441
00:18:22,807 --> 00:18:25,010
I'll cover that bet.
I get it.

442
00:18:25,086 --> 00:18:27,127
Well, Morty, I think
you're doing that smirky face

443
00:18:27,183 --> 00:18:28,876
because you're misinterpreting
the moment.

444
00:18:28,924 --> 00:18:31,197
I am not being coy
about some hidden love for you.

445
00:18:31,268 --> 00:18:33,696
I want to be really clear that
if anyone has a better guess,

446
00:18:33,744 --> 00:18:36,549
like, if I gave you
an amulet last night, or...

447
00:18:37,479 --> 00:18:39,026
Phew.

448
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,385
Oh, shit.

449
00:18:44,372 --> 00:18:46,690
Sorry. I'm... not good
at goodbyes,

450
00:18:46,738 --> 00:18:49,760
and... I'm drunk,
so, you know, I just...

451
00:18:50,018 --> 00:18:52,049
it looks like I'm never
going to see you again.

452
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:54,007
I can't really roll
with the hero types.

453
00:18:54,043 --> 00:18:56,268
And I don't... they...
They don't want me around.

454
00:18:56,316 --> 00:18:59,768
But... I want you to know, even if
I didn't show it at the time,

455
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,349
I really appreciated
you sticking by me.

456
00:19:03,096 --> 00:19:06,408
God damn it, why am I crying?
It makes no sense.

457
00:19:06,619 --> 00:19:08,477
Ugh, you're...
You're probably confused

458
00:19:08,525 --> 00:19:09,556
because we barely
knew each other,

459
00:19:09,592 --> 00:19:11,205
but... you really
stuck your neck out

460
00:19:11,253 --> 00:19:12,993
when you gave me props
for my awesome jokes

461
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:14,274
in the briefing room.

462
00:19:14,322 --> 00:19:16,831
Everybody else had their head
so far up their ass.

463
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:18,499
Even my own grandson is like,

464
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:20,467
"Oh, the Vindicators,
they're so cool."

465
00:19:20,503 --> 00:19:23,712
I mean, he's a moron,
that's their demographic.

466
00:19:23,856 --> 00:19:25,226
But you're different,
Noob Noob.

467
00:19:25,274 --> 00:19:27,141
Mother

468
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,476
You're cool.
And you're smart.

469
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,079
And I bet
we coulda hung out and shit.

470
00:19:32,134 --> 00:19:34,712
And I hope you get to be
a full-fledged Vindicator

471
00:19:34,822 --> 00:19:36,328
and... and do...
Do me a favor,

472
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:38,297
don't... don't let them know
I-I got emotional.

473
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:40,259
But you can tell them
one thing.

474
00:19:40,376 --> 00:19:42,022
Tell them I said...

475
00:19:42,244 --> 00:19:45,751
Oh Okay. I just
shit myself. Okay, later.

476
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,212
W... Dude, Morty, what
happened... Shut up.

477
00:19:54,744 --> 00:19:57,009
I sense this means
we are not dying.

478
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,705
Not all of us.

479
00:19:58,869 --> 00:20:00,040
Sweetheart.

480
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:02,026
Just let Titty Bean do this,
Snuzzles.

481
00:20:02,074 --> 00:20:03,219
It's for the greater good.

482
00:20:03,267 --> 00:20:04,283
- Greater good?
- Titty Bean?

483
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:05,646
It's like you said, Morty.

484
00:20:05,681 --> 00:20:07,781
- There's no right or wrong...
- Never said that.

485
00:20:07,861 --> 00:20:10,717
It's the galaxy's faith
in the Vindicators

486
00:20:10,753 --> 00:20:12,783
that keeps
the galaxy secure.

487
00:20:12,831 --> 00:20:14,095
Yeah,
I feel safer already.

488
00:20:14,143 --> 00:20:16,384
No doubt, who do we make
the check out to?

489
00:20:16,432 --> 00:20:18,664
I will say we are getting
some good licks in

490
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,227
- while choking to death...
- Right?

491
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:21,795
Titty Bean.
Listen to me.

492
00:20:21,843 --> 00:20:23,107
When you came to me,

493
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:25,587
I was merely
a sentient colony of ants.

494
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:28,509
It was your beliefs,
your pursuit of justice...

495
00:20:28,557 --> 00:20:30,845
that taught me
to be a man.

496
00:20:31,535 --> 00:20:33,335
When did it get
so complicated?

497
00:20:33,383 --> 00:20:36,189
Who knows.
But we can make it simple again.

498
00:20:36,275 --> 00:20:38,145
You were always
the romantic.

499
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,572
Which is why you can't leave,
either.

500
00:20:43,963 --> 00:20:46,064
I'm sorry, my love.

501
00:20:46,603 --> 00:20:48,961
Damn! She double-crossed
Snuzzles!

502
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:51,883
Silence!
I'm going to enjoy this...

503
00:20:51,931 --> 00:20:54,353
<i>Let's give a huge thanks to Rick Sanchez</i>

504
00:20:54,401 --> 00:20:57,024
<i>for killing Worldender, putting
this awesome party together,</i>

505
00:20:57,072 --> 00:21:00,334
<i>and for booking one of
the hottest talents out there...</i>

506
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:03,619
- Logic!
- Awe, yeah.

507
00:21:03,768 --> 00:21:05,205
Look at that.
It's going down.

508
00:21:05,253 --> 00:21:06,822
Geez, I must have planned
a whole party.

509
00:21:06,924 --> 00:21:08,330
