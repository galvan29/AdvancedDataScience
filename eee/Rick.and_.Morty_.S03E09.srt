00:00:10,273 --> 00:00:12,574
<i> The man
that once ate his own son...</i>

6
00:00:12,641 --> 00:00:15,020
Wow. He's really getting executed after all
this time... is finally being put down

7
00:00:15,077 --> 00:00:15,927
at the state
correctional facility.

8
00:00:15,985 --> 00:00:17,022
You know the son
that he ate was...

9
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:18,115
Your best friend...
Tommy.

10
00:00:18,173 --> 00:00:19,308
We know.
Stop true-crime bragging.

11
00:00:19,365 --> 00:00:21,258
I was traumatized,
Summer.

12
00:00:21,316 --> 00:00:22,705
Okay, your generation
wouldn't get that.

13
00:00:22,762 --> 00:00:23,863
Bitch, my generation

14
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,498
gets traumatized
for breakfast.

15
00:00:25,565 --> 00:00:28,235
It took years of therapy
to even process the reality.

16
00:00:28,302 --> 00:00:29,535
I mean,
when I was a kid,

17
00:00:29,602 --> 00:00:31,704
I just told myself
that Tommy had gotten lost

18
00:00:31,771 --> 00:00:33,839
in the magical realm
of Froopyland.

19
00:00:33,906 --> 00:00:35,841
"Froopyland?"
My make-believe world.

20
00:00:35,908 --> 00:00:38,511
I know the name's stupid,
but it was so real to me.

21
00:00:38,578 --> 00:00:40,056
Aren't you guys supposed
to be at your father's

22
00:00:40,113 --> 00:00:41,181
for custody weekend?

23
00:00:41,248 --> 00:00:43,183
We're not in a hurry.
Dad sleeps until sundown.

24
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,207
Can we talk a little bit more
about this Froopy...

25
00:00:45,265 --> 00:00:46,123
Not the bubble gun!

26
00:00:46,181 --> 00:00:48,451
There's no air...

27
00:00:48,919 --> 00:00:51,798
I gotta say, I am warming up
to the bubble gun.

28
00:00:51,858 --> 00:00:53,336
You know, if you're so great
at naming things,

29
00:00:53,393 --> 00:00:54,661
why don't you do it
from now on?

30
00:00:54,728 --> 00:00:55,928
- What?
- Froopyland.

31
00:00:55,995 --> 00:00:57,930
Was it my best work?
I don't know.

32
00:00:57,997 --> 00:00:59,799
Does it deserve
to be shit on creatively?

33
00:00:59,866 --> 00:01:00,920
Yeah, that's right.

34
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:02,911
I agree with your look
of horrified realization.

35
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:05,311
You can be very inconsiderate
sometimes.

36
00:01:06,798 --> 00:01:07,834
Here it is.

37
00:01:07,892 --> 00:01:09,586
You know, I collapsed
a quantum tesseract to...

38
00:01:09,643 --> 00:01:10,886
Dad, I don't care
how you made it.

39
00:01:10,943 --> 00:01:12,422
I want to know if Tommy's
still in there!

40
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,790
Relax, Beth.

41
00:01:13,847 --> 00:01:15,248
If he is,
we'll find him.

42
00:01:15,315 --> 00:01:17,006
He'll be the only
sun-bleached skeleton

43
00:01:17,064 --> 00:01:18,967
with non-imaginary DNA.

Tommy!

Tommy!

54
00:01:53,764 --> 00:01:54,873
This is a nightmare.

55
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:56,456
I can't believe
you used to lock me up

56
00:01:56,514 --> 00:01:58,124
in this glorified
chicken coop.

57
00:01:58,191 --> 00:01:59,192
Chicken coop?

58
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:01,287
Those are procedurally
generated clouds, Beth.

59
00:02:01,345 --> 00:02:03,194
That river is a rainbow.
Literally.

60
00:02:03,252 --> 00:02:05,358
Come on, I-I-I put real
elbow grease into this place.

61
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,632
Well, you're supposed to put
elbow grease into your daughter!

62
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:08,287
Gross.

63
00:02:08,345 --> 00:02:09,913
- Do you think something ate him?
- Nope.

64
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,879
Froopyland creatures
were designed to be harmless.

65
00:02:11,936 --> 00:02:13,373
He definitely
just starved to death.

66
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,084
I could have been the one
who starved to death in here.

67
00:02:15,141 --> 00:02:16,303
What if
I'd gotten hurt?

68
00:02:16,361 --> 00:02:18,019
God, you're right.
I'm a terrible dad.

69
00:02:18,077 --> 00:02:19,479
Well,
nothing to live for.

70
00:02:19,546 --> 00:02:21,547
- Goodbye, cruel world!
- Dad!

71
00:02:21,614 --> 00:02:23,225
Oh, how do you like that?

72
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:26,052
What kind of merciless creator
makes the ground bouncy?

73
00:02:26,119 --> 00:02:27,764
I'm gonna have
to drown myself.

74
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,989
Unh!

75
00:02:29,047 --> 00:02:31,357
Oh, no.
Oh, the water's breathable?

76
00:02:31,424 --> 00:02:32,339
Who went and did that?

77
00:02:32,397 --> 00:02:33,364
Oh, whatever.

78
00:02:33,422 --> 00:02:34,523
Yeah, whatever.

79
00:02:34,581 --> 00:02:36,571
A dad makes a toilet
look like R2-D2,

80
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:37,971
and it breaks the front page
of Reddit,

81
00:02:38,028 --> 00:02:39,865
but I'm Charles Manson
because I gave you

82
00:02:39,932 --> 00:02:41,403
your own world
instead of an iPad.

83
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,393
I think the words you're
looking for are... Aah!

84
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,583
Holy fuck! Shit!
This thing has claws!

85
00:02:45,641 --> 00:02:47,611
Yeah, I get it.
It's a childproof world.

86
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:49,786
No, no, seriously,
this hurts really bad!

87
00:02:49,942 --> 00:02:51,903
This thing is sinking
razor-sharp claws in...

88
00:02:51,961 --> 00:02:53,379
- Aah!
- Shit!

89
00:02:53,437 --> 00:02:55,786
You've made your point,
Dad.

90
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:57,149
Dad?

91
00:02:58,105 --> 00:02:59,355
Ugh!

92
00:03:01,554 --> 00:03:04,424
Whose idea was this stupid
custody weekend thing?

93
00:03:04,491 --> 00:03:06,845
I think it's supposed to help
prevent abandonment issues.

94
00:03:06,903 --> 00:03:07,993
I want
to be abandoned.

95
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,614
Yeah, I'm talking about Dad.

96
00:03:09,672 --> 00:03:11,440
Bienvenue a la
Chez Divorced Dad.

97
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:13,032
Wow, Dad.

98
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:15,201
Your place looks way less
like a crackhouse.

99
00:03:15,268 --> 00:03:17,903
It's actually clean,
like a cocaine house.

100
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,105
Dad,
what's going on?

101
00:03:19,172 --> 00:03:21,374
I'm simply centered,
activated...

102
00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:23,643
And telekinetic?

103
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,744
Pretty cool, huh?

104
00:03:24,811 --> 00:03:26,646
Check it out.
Who wants a smoothie?

105
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:30,416
Oh... Oh, no.
Uh, oh, God.

106
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,591
Summer... Summer,
can you...

107
00:03:31,651 --> 00:03:32,918
- Aah!
- Sorry.

108
00:03:32,985 --> 00:03:35,481
You have
much to learn, my Uloo.

109
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,518
Morty, Summer,
this is Kiara.

110
00:03:38,576 --> 00:03:40,596
She's a Krootabulan
warrior priestess

111
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,927
from Krootabulon.

112
00:03:41,994 --> 00:03:44,163
I-I know where Krootabulans
are from, Dad.

113
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,299
Uh, Chaimuntolo.

114
00:03:45,357 --> 00:03:46,674
Chaimuntolo,
younglings.

115
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,268
Hymen... cholo.

116
00:03:48,335 --> 00:03:50,102
Your father's mind
holds love for you.

117
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:52,088
I am humbled to meet
in physicality.

118
00:03:52,146 --> 00:03:53,307
Dad, are you...

119
00:03:53,373 --> 00:03:56,208
In love with a badass,
sexy alien lady?

120
00:03:56,275 --> 00:03:58,411
Ha, ha, I don't know, Summer.
You tell me.

121
00:03:58,478 --> 00:04:00,446
I wasn't going to ask
if you were in love

122
00:04:00,504 --> 00:04:02,400
- since you barely know her.
- Summer.

123
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,502
Kiara and I met on that
interstellar dating service

124
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,594
Rick was
always suggesting

125
00:04:05,652 --> 00:04:06,979
when your mom and I
were together.

126
00:04:07,037 --> 00:04:09,376
And... things just
kind of clicked.

127
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:10,713
We must move!

128
00:04:10,804 --> 00:04:12,406
Our reservation
is at 7:00.

129
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,153
I hate
to see her leave,

130
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,162
but I love to watch
her phase shift away.

131
00:04:17,229 --> 00:04:19,165
I'm sure you noticed
what she has three of,

132
00:04:19,278 --> 00:04:21,880
but guess what
she has two of?

133
00:04:24,994 --> 00:04:26,071
Oof!

134
00:04:26,138 --> 00:04:27,268
All right,
knock it off!

135
00:04:27,326 --> 00:04:28,736
Listen, I've been
giving you a pass

136
00:04:28,794 --> 00:04:31,088
because I'm charmed
that life finds a way, but...

137
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:32,783
Aah!
All right, you know what?

138
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:34,885
Ouch!

139
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:37,072
Oh! Unh!
Ouch!

140
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:38,236
God!

141
00:04:38,294 --> 00:04:39,395
Aah!

142
00:04:40,271 --> 00:04:41,908
Agh!

143
00:04:43,106 --> 00:04:44,966
Oh, Dad, this place
is the safest.

144
00:04:45,024 --> 00:04:46,080
Best dad ever.

145
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:48,488
Can't you just say,
"I admit it, I screwed up"?

146
00:04:48,546 --> 00:04:49,789
Uh, what would be
the point of that?

147
00:04:49,846 --> 00:04:51,289
You can't do it, can you?

148
00:04:51,346 --> 00:04:53,385
You can't just
fucking apologize.

149
00:04:53,443 --> 00:04:55,658
Okay, okay,
Beth, I'm sorry...

150
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,763
you think you deserve
an apology.

151
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,655
Hey,
don't look at me.

152
00:04:59,713 --> 00:05:01,390
You let your kid roll around
on the floor of a target,

153
00:05:01,447 --> 00:05:02,675
it's gonna
get stepped on.

154
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,981
Huh. Well, here's the problem
right here.

155
00:05:09,048 --> 00:05:11,217
We've got a bunch of
Froopyland procedural carbons

156
00:05:11,284 --> 00:05:13,953
all gummed up and mixed in
with real human DNA.

157
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,436
Are you saying
Tommy survived here

158
00:05:15,494 --> 00:05:16,895
by having sex
with Froopy creatures,

159
00:05:16,953 --> 00:05:18,388
creating Froopy-human
hybrid offspring,

160
00:05:18,445 --> 00:05:19,792
and then consuming
their proteins,

161
00:05:19,859 --> 00:05:22,004
sustaining himself with an endless
cycle of cannibalistic incest?

162
00:05:22,061 --> 00:05:23,231
It's just
a working theory.

163
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:24,407
Of course,
if that's the case,

164
00:05:24,464 --> 00:05:25,942
I expect he'd be worshiped
as a kind of god

165
00:05:25,999 --> 00:05:27,109
by a medieval-level
society

166
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,535
of his least-delicious
children.

167
00:05:28,608 --> 00:05:31,098
Halt! You are now prisoners
of our exalted ruler,

168
00:05:31,156 --> 00:05:32,383
giver and taker
of life,

169
00:05:32,441 --> 00:05:34,206
helper and consumer
of mortality,

170
00:05:34,273 --> 00:05:35,837
- dispenser of life...
- Yes, if I could interrupt?

171
00:05:35,894 --> 00:05:36,899
We're way ahead
of the reveal here.

172
00:05:36,956 --> 00:05:38,500
Yeah, just take us
to King Tommy.

173
00:05:38,734 --> 00:05:39,992
I thought
warrior priestesses

174
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,012
could only leave Krootabulon
on a hunt.

175
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,182
- Mmm.
- Thank you, sweetie.

176
00:05:43,249 --> 00:05:45,180
I hope it's not
human season.

177
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,887
I'm on Earth hunting the Varrix.
I would never hunt a human.

178
00:05:48,977 --> 00:05:51,039
Your father and I
are soul-bonded.

179
00:05:51,097 --> 00:05:52,153
Soul-bonded?

180
00:05:52,211 --> 00:05:54,035
Um, does your planet
have shorter days,

181
00:05:54,093 --> 00:05:56,228
because you guys are moving
kind of fast, no?

182
00:05:57,764 --> 00:06:00,560
♪♪ Dramatic music plays...

183
00:06:01,696 --> 00:06:02,764
Go get him, honey!

184
00:06:02,828 --> 00:06:04,656
She's always hunting.

185
00:06:04,974 --> 00:06:06,826
She probably knew
a Varrix worked here,

186
00:06:06,888 --> 00:06:09,141
and that's why she said
the Yelp reviews didn't matter.

187
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,287
Dad, do you understand

188
00:06:10,345 --> 00:06:12,604
how serious
Krootabulon soul-bonding is?

189
00:06:12,646 --> 00:06:16,131
Uh, gee, Morty, I don't know.
It's got such a casual name.

190
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:18,045
If you want to lecture anyone
about commitment,

191
00:06:18,103 --> 00:06:19,006
start with your mom.

192
00:06:19,064 --> 00:06:21,435
Oh, my God.
Dad, is that what this is about?

193
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:23,732
Are you rushing into a new thing
to get back at Mom?

194
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,991
Every weekend, you two
have told me to move on.

195
00:06:26,049 --> 00:06:27,384
Move on, like,
out of bed.

196
00:06:27,527 --> 00:06:29,748
Like, stop using paper towels
for toilet paper,

197
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,941
not... move on
into a sloppy rebound.

198
00:06:32,031 --> 00:06:34,567
Dad, you need to slow down,
rethink this soul bond.

199
00:06:34,634 --> 00:06:36,903
Why don't you just say
what you really mean?

200
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,103
You think it's cool

201
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,982
that having sex with her
gives me telekinesis

202
00:06:40,047 --> 00:06:42,115
and you recognize
she's got a hot bod

203
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,876
like Cheetara
in "Thundercats,"

204
00:06:43,943 --> 00:06:45,144
but you're grossed out

205
00:06:45,211 --> 00:06:47,613
by her avocado-shaped head
and blue skin,

206
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,724
and you think I want to put
a bag and a wig on her head.

207
00:06:51,568 --> 00:06:53,352
After all the time
and energy I spent

208
00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:55,102
teaching you two
about race...

209
00:06:55,274 --> 00:06:56,782
you ended up racist.

210
00:06:57,493 --> 00:06:59,490
Soon your world
will be rid of Varrix.

211
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:01,326
Tomorrow,
we celebrate.

212
00:07:01,393 --> 00:07:02,972
We could take the kids
to the water park.

213
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:05,097
We celebrate
with a hunt!

214
00:07:05,156 --> 00:07:07,025
Ooh.
You kids want to hunt?

215
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,100
- Yes.
- Yes.

216
00:07:09,836 --> 00:07:12,938
All kneel
for King Tommy!

217
00:07:13,114 --> 00:07:14,881
I'm not kneeling.
Suck my dick.

218
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,779
Well, hello, all!

219
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:19,058
I am the King
of Froopyland,

220
00:07:19,133 --> 00:07:21,638
but I go
by another name, too.

221
00:07:21,696 --> 00:07:23,530
- We know.
- It's Tommy!

222
00:07:23,588 --> 00:07:24,789
- We know.
- We know.

223
00:07:24,847 --> 00:07:27,943
I have lived here
since I was a mere child.

224
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,074
- We know.
- Got it.

225
00:07:29,132 --> 00:07:30,667
I suppose
you're wondering,

226
00:07:30,725 --> 00:07:32,724
how do I
sustain myself?

227
00:07:32,782 --> 00:07:33,850
- Oh, boy.
- No, we aren't.

228
00:07:33,908 --> 00:07:35,876
I always find
the theater

229
00:07:35,968 --> 00:07:38,272
is the best way
to clarify things.

230
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,331
- Ugh.
- Seriously?

231
00:07:39,398 --> 00:07:41,295
Oh, my God.
Players, go!

232
00:07:41,353 --> 00:07:42,753
I am little Tommy.

233
00:07:44,116 --> 00:07:45,718
I am tiny Beth.

234
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,841
Oh, come on.

235
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,860
Come with me
to a magic land.

236
00:07:50,918 --> 00:07:51,740
Don't do it!

237
00:07:51,798 --> 00:07:53,982
This is
my secret Froopyland

238
00:07:54,095 --> 00:07:56,163
where I have no rules!

239
00:07:56,221 --> 00:07:57,423
I am excited.

240
00:07:57,617 --> 00:08:01,787
I am jealous of Tommy's friends
and his Nintendo

241
00:08:01,861 --> 00:08:03,630
and his dad
who likes him.

242
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,125
I take it Tommy wasn't
class playwright.

243
00:08:06,192 --> 00:08:08,060
You want to see
the Honey Swamp?

244
00:08:08,127 --> 00:08:10,162
Yes!
Let's do it!

245
00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:12,098
Well,
I want to see you dead.

246
00:08:12,165 --> 00:08:14,466
Ow, help!
I'm stuck!

247
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:15,835
I'm covered in honey.

248
00:08:15,902 --> 00:08:17,570
Huh.
Well, that's interesting.

249
00:08:17,637 --> 00:08:18,738
Fake news.

250
00:08:18,805 --> 00:08:20,439
Many nights have passed,

251
00:08:20,506 --> 00:08:23,242
trapped
in this strange land.

252
00:08:23,309 --> 00:08:28,581
I am hungry, and all I can do
to pass the time is hump.

253
00:08:28,648 --> 00:08:30,917
I will hump this rock.

254
00:08:32,284 --> 00:08:34,020
I will hump this tree.

255
00:08:35,321 --> 00:08:37,890
I will hump
this beast of the land

256
00:08:37,957 --> 00:08:39,859
and put my seed in it.

257
00:08:41,393 --> 00:08:44,530
I am the first
of Tommy's children.

258
00:08:44,588 --> 00:08:48,203
Eat of my flesh
so you may survive.

259
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:50,177
And so I did.

260
00:08:51,004 --> 00:08:52,572
Oh, wow.

261
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:53,839
Okay.
Yeah.

262
00:08:53,906 --> 00:08:56,398
Certified fresh.
Good... Good job.

263
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,844
Perhaps a demonstration is
in order.

264
00:08:58,911 --> 00:09:01,180
No, that is the last thing
that is in order! Ugh.

265
00:09:01,247 --> 00:09:02,749
- Oh, my God.
- Poor Froopy character.

266
00:09:02,807 --> 00:09:04,033
Leave him alone.

267
00:09:04,413 --> 00:09:06,467
Ahh. Gather round, gang!

268
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:07,567
Dinner time.

269
00:09:08,928 --> 00:09:11,113
All right, that's it.
I'm outta here.

270
00:09:12,012 --> 00:09:13,453
What are you doing?

271
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,899
We're in the middle
of an adventure.

272
00:09:14,956 --> 00:09:16,572
Here's some things
an adventure needs, Beth.

273
00:09:16,629 --> 00:09:18,773
Conflict, stakes,
a way for me to benefit,

274
00:09:18,831 --> 00:09:20,208
and, clearly, Morty.

275
00:09:20,266 --> 00:09:21,793
But Tommy's
still in there,

276
00:09:21,851 --> 00:09:23,435
raping Muppets
and eating babies.

277
00:09:23,502 --> 00:09:25,104
Yep. Luckily,
that's not our problem.

278
00:09:25,171 --> 00:09:26,238
Time to pull the plug.

279
00:09:26,305 --> 00:09:27,439
Pull the plug?

280
00:09:27,506 --> 00:09:29,208
We have to get Tommy
out of there, okay?

281
00:09:29,275 --> 00:09:30,586
We... We need to do
the right thing.

282
00:09:30,643 --> 00:09:32,078
Do what you never did
as a dad...

283
00:09:32,145 --> 00:09:33,278
Put in a little effort.

284
00:09:33,345 --> 00:09:34,590
All right,
cut the high-road routine.

285
00:09:34,647 --> 00:09:36,215
We both saw
Tommy's shitty play.

286
00:09:36,282 --> 00:09:37,882
You pushed him
in the Honey Swamp, Beth.

287
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:39,752
His very happy life
is in your hands.

288
00:09:39,819 --> 00:09:41,320
You go save him
from it.

289
00:09:41,387 --> 00:09:43,632
You're gonna believe
a play over your own daughter?

290
00:09:43,689 --> 00:09:46,092
Yes, I am, Beth, because
you're not my own daughter.

291
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,010
Oh, God, yes.

292
00:09:47,075 --> 00:09:48,400
I'm one of infinite Beths

293
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,367
with infinite fathers
in infinite universes.

294
00:09:50,425 --> 00:09:52,075
It's called a hug, Dad.
It won't kill you.

295
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,289
Yeah, don't be so sure.

296
00:09:53,356 --> 00:09:54,943
You know why all Ricks
made a Froopyland

297
00:09:55,001 --> 00:09:56,102
for all their
little girls?

298
00:09:56,169 --> 00:09:57,266
Same reason
I wasn't surprised

299
00:09:57,323 --> 00:09:59,171
by Tommy's overwritten,
badly structured,

300
00:09:59,229 --> 00:10:00,539
cheaply produced
flashback.

301
00:10:00,606 --> 00:10:02,543
You were a scary fuckin' kid,
man.

302
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:03,752
Oh, my God.

303
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,778
I didn't make Froopyland
to get rid of you, Beth.

304
00:10:05,845 --> 00:10:07,513
I did it to protect
the neighborhood.

305
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,081
Not in a
noble sense.

306
00:10:09,148 --> 00:10:10,659
It was just more practical
to sequester you

307
00:10:10,716 --> 00:10:13,324
before I had to start,
you know, cloning a replacement

308
00:10:13,382 --> 00:10:15,879
for every less-than-polite
little boy or gullible animal

309
00:10:15,937 --> 00:10:17,565
that might cross
your socio-path.

310
00:10:17,623 --> 00:10:19,524
You would rather believe
I'm evil

311
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,371
than admit that
you were a bad father?

312
00:10:21,437 --> 00:10:22,445
Oh, dude, no.

313
00:10:22,503 --> 00:10:24,340
No, bad father all the way
to the max over here.

314
00:10:24,397 --> 00:10:25,597
I'm a fuckin' nutcase.

315
00:10:25,664 --> 00:10:27,656
And the acorn plopped
straight down, baby.

316
00:10:27,718 --> 00:10:28,768
Look at
some of this shit

317
00:10:28,835 --> 00:10:30,352
you were asking me
to make you as a kid.

318
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:31,429
Ray guns.

319
00:10:31,487 --> 00:10:33,390
A whip that forces people
to like you.

320
00:10:33,472 --> 00:10:37,309
Invisibility cuffs,
a parent trap, a lightning gun,

321
00:10:37,376 --> 00:10:39,812
a teddy bear with
anatomically correct innards,

322
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:43,742
night-vision googly-eye glasses,
sound-erasing sneakers,

323
00:10:43,835 --> 00:10:46,882
false fingerprints,
fall-asleep darts,

324
00:10:46,953 --> 00:10:50,489
a lie-detecting doll,
an indestructible baseball bat,

325
00:10:50,556 --> 00:10:54,059
a Taser shaped like a ladybug,
a fake police badge,

326
00:10:54,126 --> 00:10:57,596
location-tracking stickers,
rainbow-colored duct tape,

327
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:01,070
mind-control hair clips,
poison gum,

328
00:11:01,137 --> 00:11:03,377
a pink,
sentient switchblade.

329
00:11:03,435 --> 00:11:05,037
Hi, Beth,
you've gotten taller.

330
00:11:05,104 --> 00:11:06,205
Shall we resume
stabbing?

331
00:11:06,272 --> 00:11:07,372
Has it occurred to you

332
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,545
that I asked you
to make those things

333
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:10,458
because I wanted you
to spend time with me?

334
00:11:10,576 --> 00:11:13,107
Has it occurred to you that
if I did try killing Tommy,

335
00:11:13,165 --> 00:11:15,228
it might be because
I was jealous of his family?

336
00:11:15,286 --> 00:11:16,306
Wait, what?
Why?

337
00:11:16,364 --> 00:11:18,070
Wasn't his dad, like,
some kind of cannibal?

338
00:11:18,127 --> 00:11:19,427
Seems like it must be
hereditary.

339
00:11:19,485 --> 00:11:21,187
Oh, my God.
This is your fault.

340
00:11:21,254 --> 00:11:22,554
I am not a bad person.

341
00:11:22,621 --> 00:11:23,798
I'm gonna go back
in there,

342
00:11:23,856 --> 00:11:25,986
I'm getting Tommy,
and I'm fixing this!

343
00:11:26,092 --> 00:11:29,404
Whatever you say, Stone Cold Steve Austin.

344
00:11:29,762 --> 00:11:31,196
I don't know why
I just said that.

345
00:11:31,286 --> 00:11:33,621
Doesn't make a lot of sense,
but gotta stand by it.

346
00:11:33,766 --> 00:11:36,235
Whatever you say,
Stone Cold Steve Austin.

347
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:37,597
I'm owning it.

348
00:11:40,978 --> 00:11:43,347
No, Dad! You're not doing it right!

349
00:11:43,429 --> 00:11:45,794
Cutting off their heads
isn't doing it right?

350
00:11:45,852 --> 00:11:47,946
They're
clearly regenerative!

351
00:11:48,017 --> 00:11:50,548
I-I think you have to stab them
through the heart or something.

352
00:11:50,615 --> 00:11:51,779
You think or you know?

353
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:54,452
I thought you were the alien
expert, Isaac Asi-hole.

354
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:56,254
Don't snap at me!
I'm tired!

355
00:11:56,321 --> 00:11:57,931
- Me, too!
- We're all tired!

356
00:12:01,492 --> 00:12:03,009
That's
the last of them.

357
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,423
Tonight,
we celebrate.

358
00:12:04,486 --> 00:12:05,492
With a hunt?

359
00:12:05,626 --> 00:12:09,486
Yes, for tomorrow,
we hunt.

360
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,481
I, uh, really have to get out
of this soul bond.

361
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,984
- What the fuck, Dad?
- Oh, my God! Duh!

362
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,052
- Obviously!
- Yeah, no kidding!

363
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:24,071
Can you guys help me?

364
00:12:24,129 --> 00:12:25,154
What? How?

365
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:27,459
Can I just, uh, tell her
it's because of my kids?

366
00:12:27,517 --> 00:12:29,692
You know, like, you don't like
the shape of her head, or...

367
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,984
That's you, Dad!
That's you!

368
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:33,935
You're a baby
and an idiot!

369
00:12:33,993 --> 00:12:36,263
I think that's been established,
Summer. Now help me!

370
00:12:36,321 --> 00:12:37,631
First,
I want you to admit

371
00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:40,060
that you're a closet racist,
a beta-male sexist,

372
00:12:40,118 --> 00:12:42,313
and you dragged everyone
into a horrible situation

373
00:12:42,371 --> 00:12:43,839
by only thinking
of ourself.

374
00:12:43,906 --> 00:12:44,673
Okay.

375
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,442
I want
to hear you say it.

376
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,413
Look,
I'm a closeted racist,

377
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,114
and I'm sexist
and selfish,

378
00:12:52,181 --> 00:12:55,418
and I dragged us all into
my sexist, racist bad things

379
00:12:55,485 --> 00:12:56,985
because I'm stupid.
Thank you.

380
00:12:57,052 --> 00:12:59,188
Now you're gonna help me, right?
She just did.

381
00:12:59,255 --> 00:13:00,902
Yeah,
clean up your own mess.

382
00:13:00,979 --> 00:13:02,668
Wait, wait, what?

383
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,311
Oh, man.

384
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,538
All right, everybody.

385
00:13:06,596 --> 00:13:07,797
Next item
on the docket...

386
00:13:07,864 --> 00:13:09,899
I would like to have sex
with some of you,

387
00:13:09,966 --> 00:13:12,294
and then eat the babies.

388
00:13:12,735 --> 00:13:14,002
I thought
you'd like that.

389
00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:15,901
I do keep rolling out
the hits, don't I?

390
00:13:17,121 --> 00:13:19,657
Oh!
It's the Magic Crayon Lady!

391
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:22,378
Are you hungry?
I was just about to make dinner.

392
00:13:22,445 --> 00:13:24,013
And by "make dinner,"
I mean...

393
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,782
Tommy, I'm going to take you
to the real world.

394
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:28,065
Well, this is
the real world.

395
00:13:28,123 --> 00:13:29,861
No, you don't understand!
Your dad...

396
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:31,802
Uh, people think
your dad ate you!

397
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,361
So?
You doy-oy!

398
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:34,853
People should
eat people.

399
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:36,053
Just leave me alone!

400
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,855
Tommy,
you don't understand.

401
00:13:37,922 --> 00:13:39,156
I have to make this right

402
00:13:39,223 --> 00:13:41,225
because it's my fault
that you're in here.

403
00:13:41,292 --> 00:13:42,877
I'm Beth.

404
00:13:43,127 --> 00:13:44,195
- Beth?
- The destroyer!

405
00:13:44,262 --> 00:13:45,363
The destroyer!

406
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,450
Oh, suck it up,
Princess Incest.

407
00:13:47,508 --> 00:13:48,733
You fell
into some honey.

408
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,136
Well, it tends to happen
when one is pushed into honey.

409
00:13:52,203 --> 00:13:55,240
I respect your right
to believe I pushed you.

410
00:13:55,307 --> 00:13:57,122
Oh, do I get
to have that?

411
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,333
Is my reality like
a little side of fries...

412
00:13:59,391 --> 00:14:01,712
A little Kwanzaa
you're willing to slide my way?

413
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:04,817
Yes, because I'm focused
on saving your father's life

414
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,744
because I'm not
a petty piece of shit.

415
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,806
So, then,
it should be pretty easy

416
00:14:08,873 --> 00:14:10,874
to say,
"Sorry I pushed you."

417
00:14:10,941 --> 00:14:12,476
Real easy
and not necessary,

418
00:14:12,526 --> 00:14:14,271
since you coming home
will save your dad's life

419
00:14:14,328 --> 00:14:15,395
whereas nothing is changed

420
00:14:15,462 --> 00:14:17,184
by anyone stroking
your batshit-crazy ego.

421
00:14:17,242 --> 00:14:18,086
Sorry, forgive me.

422
00:14:18,144 --> 00:14:20,094
Uh, I've been in Froopyland
for quite a while.

423
00:14:20,152 --> 00:14:21,643
Have apologies changed?

424
00:14:21,701 --> 00:14:24,371
Tommy, I'm sorry you think
you deserve an apology.

425
00:14:24,438 --> 00:14:25,705
Oh, my God.
I'm my father.

426
00:14:25,772 --> 00:14:28,508
Uh, will someone
just kill this B-word?

427
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:31,177
Hi-ya!

428
00:14:31,297 --> 00:14:33,414
Oh, my God.
I'm my father!

429
00:14:33,486 --> 00:14:34,820
Ya!
Ooh! Froopy!

430
00:14:36,282 --> 00:14:38,217
- It's stab time!
- Ooh!

431
00:14:39,486 --> 00:14:41,721
And that's why one pussy
plus two pussies

432
00:14:41,788 --> 00:14:43,992
makes a bunch of pussies.

433
00:14:44,445 --> 00:14:45,911
Come on, y'all,
I'm trying to make this

434
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,615
appealing to your
sex-addicted lifestyles.

435
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,430
Hi, I need to pull Morty out of
school. Come on, Morty.

436
00:14:50,497 --> 00:14:52,258
Ha! You heard
your daddy, Morty.

437
00:14:52,316 --> 00:14:53,618
You have
to leave school.

438
00:14:53,774 --> 00:14:55,281
Wait,
what are my values?

439
00:14:55,339 --> 00:14:56,915
Dad, what's going on?
We're going to Alaska.

440
00:14:56,972 --> 00:14:58,911
What? Why?
It's nice there.

441
00:14:58,969 --> 00:15:01,044
Also, I broke up with Kiara,
and she didn't take it well,

442
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:02,375
and she wants
to murder you two.

443
00:15:02,442 --> 00:15:04,004
What? Th-Then why
are we walking?

444
00:15:04,062 --> 00:15:05,305
I'm walking
because I'm tired.

445
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:06,499
You guys should
definitely run.

446
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:10,820
Excuse me, I just...

447
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:12,562
You know what?
I'm... I'm just gonna go left.

448
00:15:12,619 --> 00:15:14,120
No, okay, your left,
that's fine.

449
00:15:14,187 --> 00:15:16,976
Do you know what left is,
'cause... Ugh!

450
00:15:17,734 --> 00:15:19,636
What does your breakup
have to do with us?

451
00:15:19,693 --> 00:15:21,437
Yeah,
we chose Mom hands down.

452
00:15:21,523 --> 00:15:23,138
I thought we made that clear
at the lawyer's office

453
00:15:23,195 --> 00:15:25,461
and in the comments under
your weird rant on Facebook.

454
00:15:26,874 --> 00:15:29,700
She kind of blames you guys
for the breakup.

455
00:15:29,758 --> 00:15:30,414
- Why?
- Why?

456
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:32,078
Because I told her
it was your fault.

457
00:15:32,136 --> 00:15:33,180
- What?!
- What?!

458
00:15:33,531 --> 00:15:34,958
Look,
I'm not an evil person.

459
00:15:35,016 --> 00:15:37,076
I'm just not
very imaginative!

460
00:15:41,677 --> 00:15:42,700

Dad?

493
00:16:58,042 --> 00:16:59,567
I feel like
I've spent my life

494
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:02,774
pretending you're a great guy
and trying to be like you.

495
00:17:03,096 --> 00:17:04,764
And the ugly truth
has always been...

496
00:17:04,831 --> 00:17:08,668
That I'm not that great a guy
and you're exactly like me.

497
00:17:08,735 --> 00:17:09,669
Am I evil?

498
00:17:09,736 --> 00:17:11,203
Worse.
You're smart.

499
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,706
When you know nothing matters,
the universe is yours.

500
00:17:13,773 --> 00:17:15,875
And I've never met a universe
that was into it.

501
00:17:15,942 --> 00:17:17,510
The universe is
basically an animal.

502
00:17:17,577 --> 00:17:18,878
It grazes
on the ordinary.

503
00:17:18,945 --> 00:17:21,014
It creates infinite idiots
just to eat them,

504
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:23,015
not unlike your friend Timmy.
Tommy.

505
00:17:23,082 --> 00:17:24,584
Yeah, it hardly matters now,
sweetie.

506
00:17:24,651 --> 00:17:26,562
You know, smart people get
a chance to climb on top,

507
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:27,854
take reality for a ride,

508
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,623
but it'll never stop
trying to throw you.

509
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:30,857
And, eventually,
it will.

510
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,626
There's no
other way off.

511
00:17:32,693 --> 00:17:36,262
Dad, I'm out of excuses
to not be who I am.

512
00:17:36,329 --> 00:17:39,231
So who am I?
What do I do?

513
00:17:39,298 --> 00:17:40,700
My advice...
Take off.

514
00:17:40,767 --> 00:17:43,302
Put a saddle on your universe.
Let it kick itself out.

515
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:44,537
I can't do that.

516
00:17:44,604 --> 00:17:46,172
The kids,
Jerry, my job,

517
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,206
and, as much as I hate to admit
it, ABC's "The Bachelor."

518
00:17:48,263 --> 00:17:50,572
I can make a clone of you,
a perfect instance of you,

519
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:51,544
with all your memories.

520
00:17:51,611 --> 00:17:52,945
An exact copy
in every way.

521
00:17:53,012 --> 00:17:54,781
It'll love and provide
for the kids,

522
00:17:54,848 --> 00:17:58,103
do your job, and consume
broadcast-network reality TV

523
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:00,553
on the same allegedly ironic
level as you.

524
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,921
You could be gone a day,
a week,

525
00:18:01,988 --> 00:18:04,090
or the rest of your life
with zero consequences.

526
00:18:04,157 --> 00:18:05,625
The moment you decide
to come back,

527
00:18:05,692 --> 00:18:07,960
I flip a switch,
and the clone's job is done.

528
00:18:08,027 --> 00:18:09,796
It feels no pain,
it regrets nothing,

529
00:18:09,863 --> 00:18:12,529
and has zero chance
of going "Blade Runner."

530
00:18:13,206 --> 00:18:15,975
If nothing matters,
why would you do that for me?

531
00:18:16,035 --> 00:18:18,638
I don't know, maybe you matter
so little that I like you.

532
00:18:18,705 --> 00:18:20,707
Or maybe
it makes you matter.

533
00:18:20,774 --> 00:18:21,774
Maybe I love you.

534
00:18:21,841 --> 00:18:22,986
Maybe something about
your mother.

535
00:18:23,043 --> 00:18:25,302
Don't jump a gift shark
in the mouth.

536
00:18:25,585 --> 00:18:26,989
I don't know
if I can do it.

537
00:18:27,047 --> 00:18:29,041
Then stay,
and luxuriate in a life

538
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:30,817
you can finally know
you've chosen.

539
00:18:30,884 --> 00:18:33,152
My secret bonus is that
no matter what you choose,

540
00:18:33,219 --> 00:18:35,372
you're finally gonna
chill the fuck out.

541
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,529
Okay.

542
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:44,615
I know
what I want to do.

543
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:46,927
Aah!

544
00:18:46,985 --> 00:18:48,149
Ow!

545
00:18:48,576 --> 00:18:50,511
You can't run forever!

546
00:18:50,569 --> 00:18:51,803
She's really pissed off.

547
00:18:51,887 --> 00:18:53,589
I know.
It's kinda hot.

548
00:18:53,647 --> 00:18:54,847
Shut up!

549
00:18:54,937 --> 00:18:57,139
The hunters!
They're back! Run!

550
00:18:57,197 --> 00:18:59,055
- We're not hunters.
- We want to hide with you.

551
00:18:59,112 --> 00:19:00,714
We're not hiding.
We're nesting.

552
00:19:00,781 --> 00:19:01,748
Ooh la la.

553
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:04,817
The children
must be destroyed

554
00:19:04,884 --> 00:19:06,429
so that
we can be together.

555
00:19:06,487 --> 00:19:09,732
You need to break up with her,
Dad... properly!

556
00:19:10,053 --> 00:19:11,604
God damn it, Dad!

557
00:19:12,092 --> 00:19:13,706
Dump her!

558
00:19:13,764 --> 00:19:14,823
Okay, okay.

559
00:19:14,894 --> 00:19:16,796
Kiara,
let's just run away.

560
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,760
- Dad!
- Come on!

561
00:19:17,818 --> 00:19:19,213
Just rip
the Band-Aid off!

562
00:19:19,271 --> 00:19:20,151
Okay!

563
00:19:20,209 --> 00:19:22,677
Kiara, when I told you
my kids were bigoted racists

564
00:19:22,735 --> 00:19:24,537
who were demanding
I break up with you,

565
00:19:24,604 --> 00:19:25,690
I lied.

566
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:27,956
If anybody deserves to be
telekinetically strangled,

567
00:19:28,014 --> 00:19:28,877
it's me.

568
00:19:28,942 --> 00:19:31,229
I'm the one who
wants to break up.

569
00:19:32,736 --> 00:19:34,331
I... I'm not
an evil person.

570
00:19:34,422 --> 00:19:35,627
I'm lazy,
I'm cowardly,

571
00:19:35,685 --> 00:19:38,065
and... and I do not
know what I'm doing.

572
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,219
Look, I got someone pregnant
at 17.

573
00:19:40,286 --> 00:19:42,955
We're getting a divorce.
None of this is on purpose.

574
00:19:43,022 --> 00:19:44,724
I was excited
to date someone cool

575
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:47,559
because it would make
my ex notice me.

576
00:19:48,851 --> 00:19:52,387
I would expect nothing less
from humanity...

577
00:19:52,445 --> 00:19:55,183
A selfish, manipulative,
dishonest species that...

578
00:19:55,241 --> 00:19:57,695
- Kiara?
- Trandor!

579
00:19:57,753 --> 00:19:59,154
What are you
doing here?

580
00:19:59,212 --> 00:20:00,710
Just... hunting.

581
00:20:00,774 --> 00:20:02,408
Do you really expect me
to believe

582
00:20:02,466 --> 00:20:04,421
it has nothing to do
with us?

583
00:20:04,482 --> 00:20:05,968
You knew
Earth was my domain.

584
00:20:06,112 --> 00:20:07,980
I don't like what
you're insinuating.

585
00:20:08,047 --> 00:20:10,058
Dad, can we go now?
Hold on a second.

586
00:20:10,116 --> 00:20:12,885
I'm starting to get the feeling
that I was the rebound.

587
00:20:12,952 --> 00:20:14,991
Dad, you just got handed
an Ex Machina.

588
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:16,045
You're taking it.

589
00:20:16,103 --> 00:20:19,738
Varrix nests spread
across 300 galaxies,

590
00:20:19,796 --> 00:20:22,295
and you just happened to pick
this planet to hunt?

591
00:20:22,374 --> 00:20:25,597
That's Gorgon shit...
Total Gorgon shit!

592
00:20:27,382 --> 00:20:28,567
We're home!

593
00:20:28,634 --> 00:20:30,136
Hey, guys!
What's for dinner?

594
00:20:30,203 --> 00:20:31,771
- How was Jerry's?
- The usual.

595
00:20:31,838 --> 00:20:34,006
Can we have pizza?
Pizza sounds great.

596
00:20:34,073 --> 00:20:36,142
Hey, Rick, did you know my dad
was dating an alien?

597
00:20:36,209 --> 00:20:38,507
No. Gross.
For the alien.

598
00:20:38,565 --> 00:20:40,968
Aw, crap, I think
Arnaldo's is closed.

599
00:20:41,147 --> 00:20:42,715
Are you guys sure
you want pizza?

600
00:20:44,984 --> 00:20:47,053
Arnaldo's isn't closed
in the dimension

601
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,822
where they didn't invent
Daylight Savings!

602
00:20:48,889 --> 00:20:51,657
What would we do without you?
I love you, Dad.

603
00:20:51,724 --> 00:20:53,459
Love you, too,
sweetie.

604
00:20:54,693 --> 00:20:56,095
By the way,
that wasn't time travel.

605
00:20:56,162 --> 00:20:57,807
There were just a couple pizzas
on the counter.

606
00:20:57,864 --> 00:20:59,273
I grabbed them.

Hey, Jerry, it's Kiara.

00:21:32,814 --> 00:21:35,117
Listen, my boyfriend saw those
texts you've been sending me,

618
00:21:35,174 --> 00:21:36,702
and he got pretty pissed off.

619
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,771
If he calls you, just ignore him!

620
00:21:38,838 --> 00:21:40,172
This is Carmox.

621
00:21:40,239 --> 00:21:41,928
I have intercepted
sexual communications

622
00:21:41,986 --> 00:21:43,639
between you and my
new girlfriend, Kiara.

623
00:21:43,697 --> 00:21:46,017
I am coming to kill you now!

624
00:21:46,088 --> 00:21:47,369
Yo, Jerry,
it's the Big R.

625
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,522
Uh, I killed that alien
that was coming after ya.

626
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,642
Looking out for ya, buddy.

627
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,742
Hey, Jerry, it's Rick.

628
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,741
Don't be mad. I fucked
your ex-girlfriend Kiara.

629
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:55,899
Who are you
talking to, Rick?

630
00:21:55,956 --> 00:21:57,289
Doesn't matter.

631
00:21:57,356 --> 00:21:59,119
Hey, Jerry, this is Michael

632
00:21:59,177 --> 00:22:00,498
down at The Antique Phone
rentals.

633
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,312
Um, I'm gonna go ahead
and let you off the hook

634
00:22:02,369 --> 00:22:03,889
for the $70 late fee.

635
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,320
You can go ahead and keep
that answering machine.

636
00:22:05,377 --> 00:22:06,674
Nobody really
uses those anymore

637
00:22:06,732 --> 00:22:08,814
except for exposition
on TV shows, anyways.
