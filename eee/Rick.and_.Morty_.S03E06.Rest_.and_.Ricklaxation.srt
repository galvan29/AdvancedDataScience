173
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:14,433
You might have
all these idiots fooled,

174
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,753
but I know you're still
the same pathetic loser

175
00:07:16,801 --> 00:07:18,987
hiding behind
a confident facade.

176
00:07:19,245 --> 00:07:20,608
I know that because...

177
00:07:20,769 --> 00:07:22,884
I'm doing the same thing,
brother.

178
00:07:22,932 --> 00:07:25,399
I'm not alone anymore!

179
00:07:25,493 --> 00:07:28,720
Hey, Morty. Word around school
is you've become super healthy.

180
00:07:28,768 --> 00:07:30,024
I don't know
about all that.

181
00:07:30,072 --> 00:07:32,492
I do, however, know that I have
a pretty bad case of

182
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,571
haven't taken you
to dinner-itis.

183
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,949
Might be fatal.

184
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,079
Hey, kids.
Uh, hope I'm not interrupting.

185
00:07:38,127 --> 00:07:39,536
Morty,
a moment of your time?

186
00:07:39,606 --> 00:07:40,805
Happy to help, Rick.

187
00:07:40,853 --> 00:07:42,036
I hate to bug you
with this,

188
00:07:42,084 --> 00:07:44,668
but after our morning hike
I started receiving very faint,

189
00:07:44,716 --> 00:07:47,134
highly unusual transmissions
on my sub ether phone.

190
00:07:47,192 --> 00:07:48,606
Listen.

191
00:07:52,678 --> 00:07:54,123
It's a bad phone.
Chuck it.

192
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,425
I downgraded to a clamshell
for emergencies only.

193
00:07:56,473 --> 00:07:58,034
You know, if... if... if
something's worth saying,

194
00:07:58,081 --> 00:07:59,255
I-it's worth eye contact.

195
00:07:59,303 --> 00:08:01,528
Uh, I-I-I traced
the source of the call

196
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:03,038
back to the spa we went to,
Morty.

197
00:08:03,086 --> 00:08:04,391
I thought I could hear
a voice in there,

198
00:08:04,438 --> 00:08:06,633
so I enhanced it, a-and listen.

199
00:08:07,657 --> 00:08:09,645
- Hey, asshole!
- Oh, man!

200
00:08:09,692 --> 00:08:11,599
- Remember us?
- Oh, I don't like confrontation!

201
00:08:11,646 --> 00:08:13,427
You us,
you pieces of garbage!

202
00:08:13,522 --> 00:08:15,669
That's right,
you're garbage, not us.

203
00:08:15,717 --> 00:08:17,049
I'm a genius
and a god.

204
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:19,153
You really think
this thing can hold me?

205
00:08:19,201 --> 00:08:20,794
I'm gonna rip your throat

206
00:08:20,841 --> 00:08:23,208
Morty, what if the toxic parts
of us have their own identities,

207
00:08:23,255 --> 00:08:24,404
their own will to live?

208
00:08:24,466 --> 00:08:26,255
W-What if mine shares
my intelligence

209
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,052
and... devised a way
to reach out to us?

210
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:29,344
Sounds like
he's in a lot of pain.

211
00:08:29,391 --> 00:08:31,451
Lot. O. Pain.

212
00:08:31,514 --> 00:08:33,436
But, you know, you shouldn't
have to deal with that, man.

213
00:08:33,483 --> 00:08:34,982
You know,
l-let's work off your trauma

214
00:08:35,045 --> 00:08:36,359
with some urban spin yoga.

215
00:08:36,407 --> 00:08:38,053
It's amazing.
You do yoga on a bike,

216
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,445
but you have
an at-risk preteen...

217
00:08:39,507 --> 00:08:41,490
I don't think I can
just blow this off, Morty.

218
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,920
If I had known it worked this
way, I wouldn't have detoxed.

219
00:08:44,005 --> 00:08:45,951
Well, I would have
because I was toxic.

220
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:49,217
Now I'm detoxed and I'm
accountable to my toxins, right?

221
00:08:49,331 --> 00:08:51,967
I-It's a dilemma.
I think I know what to do.

222
00:08:52,342 --> 00:08:53,677
- Morty!
- Rick!

223
00:08:54,131 --> 00:08:56,311
You know, the only problem here
is a big fat brain

224
00:08:56,359 --> 00:08:58,600
that misses eating
all them big fat problems.

225
00:08:58,677 --> 00:09:01,444
Focus on the good thing.
Trust me, things are good.

226
00:09:01,553 --> 00:09:03,453
Taking that away from me...

227
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:04,998
that wouldn't be
healthy.

228
00:09:05,124 --> 00:09:06,615
♪♪ Ominous music plays...

229
00:09:08,486 --> 00:09:10,912
Oh, man. World's Greatest
Grandpa, for reals.

00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,693
It's not just a coffee cup
for you, bud.

231
00:09:12,741 --> 00:09:14,174
You're legit.

♪♪ Piano music plays...

233
00:09:18,749 --> 00:09:20,444
I love drums.
I never took drum lessons.

234
00:09:20,492 --> 00:09:23,311
Why? Limitations. We are
addicted to our own limitations.

235
00:09:23,359 --> 00:09:24,443
How amazing is that?

236
00:09:24,491 --> 00:09:25,891
Is the kale prepared
in the kitchen?

237
00:09:25,939 --> 00:09:27,444
I'll have a water.
Uh...

238
00:09:27,566 --> 00:09:29,990
How is the...
"cru-dite?"

239
00:09:30,038 --> 00:09:32,371
Crudité.
It's a cup of carrot sticks.

240
00:09:32,419 --> 00:09:34,311
Ha! It's okay!
Pronounce it however you want.

241

Words are just things.
Please. Thank you.

We're having
a conversation.

243
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:40,222
God, I am so excited
to finally have dinner with you.

244
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,757
You know how
long I've been waiting for this?

245
00:09:41,804 --> 00:09:43,186
It's like, whew!

246
00:09:43,248 --> 00:09:44,794
I-I-I wish you'd shut up,
though.

247
00:09:44,842 --> 00:09:46,740
Just kidding. You know,
you're so quiet. What's wrong?

248
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:48,030
W-Why don't you tell me
about yourself?

249
00:09:48,077 --> 00:09:49,849
What's the atmosphere like
on planet Jessica?

250
00:09:49,897 --> 00:09:51,943
Where's the equator,
what are the vacations,

251
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:52,998
a-and the holidays?

252
00:09:53,046 --> 00:09:55,654
I mean, you know,
are they the same time?

253
00:09:55,702 --> 00:09:58,508
Talk to me. Well... I...
like this restaurant.

254
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:01,701
Holy ! Holy!
We have a moron over here!

255
00:10:01,749 --> 00:10:04,068
I'm an idiot. I can't believe I haven't
thought of this.

256
00:10:04,116 --> 00:10:06,068
You have to do
this detox thing I did.

257
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:07,949
It's an alien spa,
you go through it,

258
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:09,236
fwoos-s-s-ssh,

259
00:10:09,355 --> 00:10:11,422
lasers, bwaa-bwaa-bwaa...

260
00:10:11,502 --> 00:10:13,638
sucks everything out.

261
00:10:13,686 --> 00:10:15,487
Everything that was holding me
back, everything bad,

262
00:10:15,534 --> 00:10:16,795
I mean, it just...

263
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:18,638
Right?

264
00:10:19,021 --> 00:10:20,426
Cooooool.

265
00:10:20,598 --> 00:10:22,748
Wow! Oh, my God!
I can't believe this.

266
00:10:22,796 --> 00:10:24,729
Yeah, phones are awful,
I downgraded to...

267
00:10:24,828 --> 00:10:26,427
I totally forgot my...

268
00:10:26,513 --> 00:10:29,615
I have a... thing, and...

269
00:10:30,169 --> 00:10:32,474
- Things are good.
- You know what? Why am I doing that?

270
00:10:32,522 --> 00:10:33,921
That's more rude
than the truth.

271
00:10:33,984 --> 00:10:36,029
Look, I'm sorry, Morty.
I just don't think...

272
00:10:36,077 --> 00:10:39,701
Do not. Even.
You have no need to explain.

273
00:10:39,784 --> 00:10:41,982
- It's all good.
- I think you'd get bored with me.

274
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,013
E-Exactly.
Look, the sparks aren't flying.

275
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:45,849
This is what dating is for,
you know?

276
00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:47,675
First date, no sparks.

277
00:10:47,723 --> 00:10:50,044
No damage, no worries.
Life is a highway.

278
00:10:50,131 --> 00:10:51,833
We're gonna ride it
all night lonnngg!

279
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:53,930
Gonna eat some "crudite."
Mmm!

280
00:10:54,006 --> 00:10:56,404
Is this organic? Mmm.
All right.

281
00:10:56,452 --> 00:10:58,218
You know,
the evening continues.

282
00:10:58,482 --> 00:11:00,458
Okay, here we go.

283
00:11:00,563 --> 00:11:02,896
Ma'am, I'm afraid I have
some bad news for you.

284
00:11:02,944 --> 00:11:04,334
Your money's no good here.

285
00:11:04,742 --> 00:11:06,141
I'll... I'll get the next round,
sir.

286
00:11:06,188 --> 00:11:08,740
- Aren't you a child
- Only in the ways that matter.

287
00:11:08,817 --> 00:11:10,592
- Morty.
- Stacy.

288
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,096
I've been watching you drink,
Stacy.

289
00:11:12,144 --> 00:11:13,779
I get the feeling
you've got a hard job.

290
00:11:13,827 --> 00:11:15,466
I wonder what it takes
to please you.

291
00:11:15,514 --> 00:11:17,896
That's the job I want...
Part time, full time,

292
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,420
I want to be good at it,
bad at it,

293
00:11:19,468 --> 00:11:22,209
I want to get promoted, fired,
corner office, hostile takeover,

294
00:11:22,257 --> 00:11:24,866
workplace accident...
I'm on my knees, Stacy...

295
00:11:24,926 --> 00:11:27,750
Praying, worshipping, begging,
whatever you want.

296
00:11:28,429 --> 00:11:30,421
What do you think about that?

297
00:11:31,248 --> 00:11:32,842
Okay. it.

298
00:11:32,951 --> 00:11:34,132
Tink.

299
00:11:35,952 --> 00:11:37,178
Mm!

300
00:11:37,342 --> 00:11:39,100
Let's ask my grandpa.
He's a scientist.

301
00:11:39,148 --> 00:11:42,139
Hey, Rick, are you familiar
with "benoi" technology?

302
00:11:42,187 --> 00:11:43,186
Morty, great news.

303
00:11:43,234 --> 00:11:44,768
I went back to the spa
and they let me purchase

304
00:11:44,815 --> 00:11:46,632
the containment unit
from their detoxifier.

305
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,535
- Why?
- Because we're coming home, bitch!

306
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,348
- What is this?
- This is the parts of

307
00:11:50,396 --> 00:11:51,950
your pussy grandpa
that keep it real.

308
00:11:52,028 --> 00:11:53,927
Oh... oh, and I think you
dropped something, too!

309
00:11:53,974 --> 00:11:55,029
I don't want to be
on camera.

310
00:11:55,076 --> 00:11:56,333
I'm ugly and gross,
please.

311
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:58,177
- Should I go?
- You're your own person, Stacy.

312
00:11:58,224 --> 00:11:59,234
Then I'd like to stay.

313
00:11:59,282 --> 00:12:00,300
Rick, please tell me

314
00:12:00,348 --> 00:12:02,684
you're not trying to put
that stuff back inside of us.

315
00:12:02,732 --> 00:12:05,286
Morty, I'm sorry. That stuff
is alive and it belongs with us.

316
00:12:05,334 --> 00:12:07,661
We yanked them from their homes
and locked them in a can.

317
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:09,122
Mother!

318
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,473
See?
They're living in pain.

319
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,301
That's what they do, Rick,
they live in pain.

320
00:12:12,349 --> 00:12:13,551
They<i> are</i> pain, you know?

321
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,737
They... they're all the bad
parts of us, which, by the way,

322
00:12:15,784 --> 00:12:16,879
includes our dishonesty,

323
00:12:16,927 --> 00:12:19,253
so how do you know this isn't
all some sort of crazy trick?

324
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:22,247
Oh, so now because I'm made
entirely of toxins I'm also a liar?

325
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,723
you,
you little sociopath.

326
00:12:23,771 --> 00:12:26,028
- You hear this, Morty?
- Oh, everybody hates me. I can tell.

327
00:12:26,075 --> 00:12:27,451
- Y-You all hate me...
- All right, shut up, Morty.

328
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:28,927
Healthy Rick,
are we doing this or what?

329
00:12:28,974 --> 00:12:31,113
Yep. Sorry, Morty. I need you
to step into the booth.

330
00:12:31,161 --> 00:12:33,168
Don't negotiate
with that little turd, dummy.

331
00:12:33,243 --> 00:12:35,089
You're the Rick.
You need to show dominance.

332
00:12:35,137 --> 00:12:37,817
Morty, booth, now. Booth!

333
00:12:37,903 --> 00:12:39,292
- Come on, Morty.
- Don't touch me!

334
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,122
Morty, do the healthy thing and
voluntarily retoxify yourself.

335
00:12:42,202 --> 00:12:43,387
Nooooo!

336
00:12:43,435 --> 00:12:45,066
Is it wrong if I think
this is kind of hot?

337
00:12:45,113 --> 00:12:47,238
Let me out of here!
Stacy, help! Open the door!

338
00:12:47,286 --> 00:12:49,161
I need to hear our safe word,
Morty.

339
00:12:49,247 --> 00:12:50,833
Sea Cucumber!
Sea Cucumber!

340
00:12:50,881 --> 00:12:53,048
What are you doing? I'll do
anything for you, Morty.

341
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,309
No!

342
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:59,341
It worked! Yes!
That idiot believed every word.

343
00:12:59,395 --> 00:13:02,005
Now let's see how<i> he</i> enjoys
living in that shit tank.

344
00:13:02,146 --> 00:13:03,500
He's right behind me,
isn't he?

345
00:13:03,596 --> 00:13:06,263
- He's in<i> front</i> of you.
- Oh. My eyes are still adjusting.

346
00:13:06,311 --> 00:13:08,177
Uh, is this like
a sex dungeon?

347
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,357
I guess I should've been
paying attention.

348
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:13,194
After 70 years
of being bottled up

349
00:13:13,242 --> 00:13:14,996
inside a
sentimental jackass,

350
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,476
I finally get to live
my own life.

351
00:13:16,528 --> 00:13:18,716
- You said we were merging.
- I lied, dumbass!

352
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:19,816
I lie about everything!

353
00:13:19,864 --> 00:13:21,972
Why would I ever re-merge
with a pussy like you?

354
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,089
So... you were just gonna trap us
in that tank?

355
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:27,182
T-That was your plan? Not<i> was,</i>
mother... still is.

356
00:13:27,651 --> 00:13:28,729
Kill him, Rick!

357
00:13:28,777 --> 00:13:30,098
I don't like this!
This is scary!

358
00:13:30,146 --> 00:13:31,425
All right,
you asked for it.

359
00:13:31,473 --> 00:13:32,777
Did I ask for this?

360
00:13:32,965 --> 00:13:35,251
Did I ask for this?
Huh? Did I?

361
00:13:36,025 --> 00:13:37,497
<i>Assessing threat to groin.</i>

362
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,606
Groin System 6000.
Kill him!

363
00:13:40,841 --> 00:13:42,832
<i>That... is my groin's user.</i>

364
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,974
Believe me, I got a lot more use
out of that thing

365
00:13:45,022 --> 00:13:47,864
- than he ever did.
- <i>You know what? Not my table.</i>

366
00:13:50,941 --> 00:13:55,981
<i>You</i> do<i> know me.</i>

367
00:13:56,087 --> 00:13:57,386
What the hell,
Grandpa Rick?

368
00:13:57,489 --> 00:13:58,922
you, Summer!
Sorry, Summer!

369
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,208
Okay, okay, take it easy.
Don't do it.

370
00:14:03,404 --> 00:14:04,481
I love you. Good boy.

371
00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:05,566
Daddy's little boy.

372
00:14:05,614 --> 00:14:06,662
Summer,
get out of here! Go!

373
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:07,958
Oh, who's that?

374
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,543
Who's
that over there?

375
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:12,199
- Oh, no.
- You see the bad man in front of you?

376
00:14:12,247 --> 00:14:13,796
You're a good little boy,
you're gonna get him.

377
00:14:13,844 --> 00:14:15,062
You're gonna get him.

378
00:14:16,436 --> 00:14:18,248
Ahh!

379
00:14:18,414 --> 00:14:19,780
Son of a...

380
00:14:25,391 --> 00:14:27,192
Ahh!

381
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:31,835
Nice try, asshole.

382
00:14:31,883 --> 00:14:33,492
We can resolve
our issues.

383
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,273
We don't need to resort
to over-the-top...

384
00:14:36,992 --> 00:14:38,084
Aah!

385
00:14:38,156 --> 00:14:39,788
I-I did it, Rick.
I got the tank!

386
00:14:39,891 --> 00:14:41,703
I-I'm a piece of ,
but I got the tank!

387
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,141
You're going in that tank,
mother.

388
00:14:43,188 --> 00:14:45,399
You're gonna live in
that toxic wasteland

389
00:14:45,446 --> 00:14:46,460
like I had to do!

390
00:14:46,515 --> 00:14:47,570
- Ahh!
- Ow!

391
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:53,191
- That's right, mother...
- You're going in that...

392
00:14:54,664 --> 00:14:56,335
Dads?

393
00:14:56,408 --> 00:14:58,101
Okay, just...
Just leave her out of it.

394
00:14:58,149 --> 00:14:59,179
What's going on?

395
00:14:59,244 --> 00:15:00,699
All right, this.
Time for plan B...

396
00:15:00,746 --> 00:15:02,639
If I can't trap you
in a toxic world,

397
00:15:02,687 --> 00:15:04,851
I'll just make the whole world
toxic.

398
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:07,436
It's okay, girls.

399
00:15:07,484 --> 00:15:10,240
I-I'm so sorry I put us in
danger with some of my behavior.

400
00:15:10,288 --> 00:15:12,648
I-If you'd like I can go out
in the g-garden,

401
00:15:12,724 --> 00:15:15,203
pick some fresh basil,
and make us a nice Scallopini.

402
00:15:15,251 --> 00:15:17,210
What did the booger version
of you mean

403
00:15:17,258 --> 00:15:19,752
when he said he was going
to make the whole world toxic?

404
00:15:19,831 --> 00:15:22,773
Believe me, sweetie, that man's
motivations are a mystery.

405
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:24,671
Screw that, Rick.
We got to stop him.

406
00:15:24,719 --> 00:15:27,187
What's the last thing you'd think
about doing with that tank thing?

407
00:15:27,234 --> 00:15:29,023
Morty, I appreciate
what you're trying to do,

408
00:15:29,071 --> 00:15:30,631
but it's not our place,
you know,

409
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,374
to pick and choose which world
gets saved from what apocalypse.

410
00:15:33,468 --> 00:15:36,390
Our... our toxins have as much
a right to their worldview as...

411
00:15:36,438 --> 00:15:38,313
Morty, how is it healthy
to slap me?

412
00:15:38,361 --> 00:15:39,749
Obviously
my version of health

413
00:15:39,797 --> 00:15:41,417
is a hell of a lot different
from yours,

414
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,328
- you useless old turd.
- Wait. That's it.

415
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:45,118
How could that detox machine
know the difference

416
00:15:45,165 --> 00:15:48,125
between healthy and sick for
everything that goes through it?

417
00:15:48,173 --> 00:15:49,180
It can't.

418
00:15:49,228 --> 00:15:52,062
It must be by the individual's
own definition of toxicity.

419
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,515
That means...

420
00:15:54,031 --> 00:15:55,905
- Dad! What the...
- What the hell, Rick?

421
00:15:55,953 --> 00:15:57,116
I'll explain on the way.

422
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,356
This "Moon Tower," Morty,

423
00:15:58,403 --> 00:16:00,655
Is the perfect height
and metallic composition

424
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:03,223
for the amplification
and beaming of toxic energies.

425
00:16:03,271 --> 00:16:04,310
What do you think about that,
Morty?

426
00:16:04,357 --> 00:16:05,709
Are you excited about that,
Morty?

427
00:16:05,772 --> 00:16:08,388
Oh, man. I'm just freaked out.
I-It's too high up here.

428
00:16:08,436 --> 00:16:09,482
Once I flip this switch,

429
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:12,216
the entire world is gonna
be just as toxic as us, baby.

430
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:18,552
♪♪

431
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:21,380
♪♪ Organ music plays...
As we praise our loving Father...

432
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:24,130
God is a lie!
We made him up for money!

433
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,435
Santa Claus isn't real.

434
00:16:31,736 --> 00:16:34,380
You were all mistakes!

435
00:16:35,952 --> 00:16:37,084
We did it, Morty.

436
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:38,436
Put your hands
in the air.

437
00:16:38,483 --> 00:16:40,357
Yeah, you little piece
of.

438
00:16:40,865 --> 00:16:42,176
Remember me?

439
00:16:42,224 --> 00:16:44,709
Didn't you learn last time
that you can't beat me?

440
00:16:44,783 --> 00:16:46,670
Yeah, I did. And then I learned
something else.

441
00:16:46,771 --> 00:16:48,287
This. Ahh!!

442
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,912
That bullet is laced with an
encrypted nanobotic virus

443
00:16:51,013 --> 00:16:53,545
that will disintegrate your
Morty in about, ah, 20 minutes.

444
00:16:53,592 --> 00:16:54,791
You think I give a?

445
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:56,240
I know you give a ,
dummy.

446
00:16:56,292 --> 00:16:57,391
Because I know I don't.

447
00:16:57,495 --> 00:16:58,716
Here's another thing
I know...

448
00:16:58,764 --> 00:17:00,539
The decryption key
that neutralizes the virus.

449
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:02,084
You want it?
Come and get it.

450
00:17:02,162 --> 00:17:03,655
Merge with me and you'll know
how to save him.

451
00:17:03,702 --> 00:17:05,185
Pfft. Come on, man.
I've been trapped

452
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,348
in your pussy brain
for 70 years of delusions,

453
00:17:07,396 --> 00:17:10,318
but this is the all-time weakest
bluff that I've ever...

454
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,295
Ow-Ohh!! Jesus Christ!
What are you doing?!

455
00:17:12,443 --> 00:17:14,575
He's cutting your time in half.
10 minutes.

456
00:17:14,623 --> 00:17:15,630
- What is your problem?
- Ohh! It hurts!

457
00:17:15,677 --> 00:17:17,717
Oh, I had all my problems
removed... my entitlement,

458
00:17:17,764 --> 00:17:19,615
my narcissism,
my crippling loneliness,

459
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,498
my irrational attachments.

460
00:17:21,747 --> 00:17:23,716
They must be somewhere.
They ain't over here, bro.

461
00:17:23,764 --> 00:17:25,163
I'm not going back in there!

462
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,811
Honestly,
I don't care either way.

463
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:28,099
I hate having you in me.

464
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:29,614
And when I say "honestly"
you can believe it,

465
00:17:29,661 --> 00:17:31,428
because we both know
I'm too healthy to lie.

466
00:17:31,485 --> 00:17:32,828
Watch.

467
00:17:33,017 --> 00:17:35,162
All right! Knock it off!
You're not impressing anyone.

468
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:37,271
Morty, not that I give
a , but are you okay?

469
00:17:37,326 --> 00:17:39,103
- Jesus Christ, it hurts.
- Relax, quit your bitching.

470
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:41,378
Y-You're gonna be fine.
Grandpa's here.

471
00:17:41,737 --> 00:17:42,872
You think that's funny?

472
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,850
Y-You got to have a sense
of humor about these things.

473
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:45,990
Oh, wait, you can't.

474
00:17:46,038 --> 00:17:48,114
You're literally incapable
of seeing the bigger picture.

475
00:17:48,161 --> 00:17:49,841
I guess it's just funny
because you've never done

476
00:17:49,888 --> 00:17:51,747
anything but complain
about me being in charge,

477
00:17:51,795 --> 00:17:54,755
but if I ever gave you the wheel
we'd be dead in five minutes.

478
00:17:54,849 --> 00:17:57,140
- Rick?
- You poor, dumb, sick animal.

479
00:17:57,188 --> 00:17:58,208
Rick?

480
00:17:58,256 --> 00:18:00,341
Ahh! Just do it!

481
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,302
Just do it, you piece of...

482
00:18:03,671 --> 00:18:06,972
I'm back, baby! Regular Rick!
Master of both worlds!

483
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,320
Check it it out!

484
00:18:08,368 --> 00:18:09,901
"Excuse me."

485
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:12,588
Now we'll just reverse
this hacky toxicity beam.

486
00:18:12,637 --> 00:18:14,424
Man, I really over think shit
when I'm angry.

487
00:18:17,342 --> 00:18:18,359
Oh, give it to me.

488
00:18:18,406 --> 00:18:20,670
Mm, ma-mah.

489
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,678
God is<i> not</i> a lie.

490
00:18:34,038 --> 00:18:35,258
Mommy! Mommy!

491
00:18:35,327 --> 00:18:36,568
Ha! All right, Morty,

492
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,328
now it's time we re-merge
your little ass.

493
00:18:38,376 --> 00:18:39,476
You're a better man
than me, Rick.

494
00:18:39,523 --> 00:18:41,131
I'm healthy
enough to admit that!

495
00:18:41,233 --> 00:18:43,577
That kid
is a real piece of.

496
00:18:43,635 --> 00:18:44,983
Y-Y-You're gonna save me,
right?

497
00:18:45,139 --> 00:18:46,903
Part of me wanted to,
Toxic Morty.

498
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:49,788
Part of me
really wanted to.

499
00:18:51,523 --> 00:18:53,518
I'm telling you,
these shares are hot. Yeah.

500
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:55,706
That sounds like a good idea.
It's definitely a good idea.

501
00:18:55,753 --> 00:18:58,011
Duane, Duane, Duane, I get it,
now can you get me?

502
00:18:58,059 --> 00:18:59,558
Have I ever lied to you?

503
00:18:59,714 --> 00:19:03,040
That's right, and ask around,
I never do, Duane.

504
00:19:03,088 --> 00:19:04,331
Let me put this real simple.

505
00:19:04,379 --> 00:19:06,810
This stock is a beautiful
redhead, recently single,

506
00:19:06,858 --> 00:19:09,158
not looking to date
but ready to fall in love,

507
00:19:09,206 --> 00:19:12,071
and fate has put her locker
two down from yours, Duane...

508
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:13,852
Two lockers down.

509
00:19:13,965 --> 00:19:15,953
So step up or step off,
Duane.

510
00:19:16,001 --> 00:19:18,801
Blue pill or red pill,
what'll be, bro?

511
00:19:20,806 --> 00:19:22,426
Totally understand, Duane.

512
00:19:22,474 --> 00:19:24,140
You're the boss.

513
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,575
Heinholz Biotech...

514
00:19:25,634 --> 00:19:27,543
Million and a half
at thirty-three.

515
00:19:27,642 --> 00:19:28,845
Heh.

516
00:19:29,298 --> 00:19:31,398
You little monster.

517
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,063
Mmm! Is this organic?

518
00:19:37,122 --> 00:19:38,654
Mmm!

519
00:19:39,891 --> 00:19:41,071
Go for Morty.

520
00:19:41,158 --> 00:19:43,024
Hi, Morty. It's Jessica.

521
00:19:43,128 --> 00:19:45,395
Look, can we just talk
for a minute?

522
00:19:45,443 --> 00:19:47,684
Is that how long it takes
for Rick to trace my location?

523
00:19:47,732 --> 00:19:49,826
Come back, Morty.
I miss you.

524
00:19:49,874 --> 00:19:50,940
You miss the old me.

525
00:19:50,988 --> 00:19:52,321
You miss someone
that loved you so much

526
00:19:52,368 --> 00:19:53,483
you never
had to love 'em back.

527
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:55,061
How do you know
I don't want to love you?

528
00:19:55,108 --> 00:19:57,408
- Because I'm not sick.
- Ex-girlfriend?

529
00:19:57,912 --> 00:20:00,467
- Should I be jealous?
- There's nothing to be jealous of.

530
00:20:00,584 --> 00:20:03,411
I just realized that I'm scheduled
to speak at that fundraiser

531
00:20:03,459 --> 00:20:04,465
on our date night.

532
00:20:04,513 --> 00:20:07,131
- I can cancel.
- We'll be together. That's a date.

533
00:20:07,179 --> 00:20:09,279
You are the perfect man.

534
00:20:09,451 --> 00:20:11,675
Oh, sweetie, I think you hit
the wrong button.

535
00:20:11,723 --> 00:20:12,849
You didn't hang up.

536
00:20:12,897 --> 00:20:15,097
Huh. How 'bout that?

537
00:20:19,373 --> 00:20:21,615
Sorry, tiny American Psycho,

538
00:20:21,663 --> 00:20:23,863
time to take the opposite
of your medicine.

539
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:26,568
Do what you got to do.

540
00:20:26,938 --> 00:20:29,592
Oh! Ow! Ahh!

541
00:20:29,841 --> 00:20:31,420
So, how do you feel,
Morty?

542
00:20:31,596 --> 00:20:34,217
- Ah, geez. I'm miserable.
- Am I good or what?

543
00:20:34,265 --> 00:20:36,575
I guess it's worth it, though,
to know how much you care.

544
00:20:36,647 --> 00:20:39,382
Care? Me?
Morty, I'm fine with you.

545
00:20:39,451 --> 00:20:41,685
- I only did this for him.
- You lying bitch.

546
00:20:41,787 --> 00:20:43,947
She kept coming to our house,
Morty, and kept asking me

547
00:20:44,053 --> 00:20:45,538
"Did... did... d-did you get
a new Morty yet?"

548
00:20:45,585 --> 00:20:48,262
Because you kept drunk dialing
me and crying about it.

549
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,325
I wasn't crying!

550
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,662
Jacquelyn, I...

551
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:52,373
I-I-I wasn't
who I said I was.

552
00:20:52,467 --> 00:20:54,990
You weren't a 14-year-old boy
from the Midwest

553
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,974
who ran away from his family
and capitalized

554
00:20:57,035 --> 00:20:59,459
on his lack of conscience
by becoming a stock broker?

555
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,842
Oh. I guess I was pretty
up front about that, wasn't I?

556
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,513
You were up front
about everything.

557
00:21:03,606 --> 00:21:05,037
You were my soul mate.

558
00:21:05,287 --> 00:21:08,615
Well...
N... Not anymore. I'll, um...

559
00:21:08,713 --> 00:21:10,113
Y-You can keep the apartment,

560
00:21:10,161 --> 00:21:12,107
and... and... and,
uh... the drones.

561
00:21:12,217 --> 00:21:13,233
She can't keep the drones.

562
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,672
They turn into
a little Voltron robot.

563
00:21:14,719 --> 00:21:15,818
They're awesome.

564
00:21:17,178 --> 00:21:19,006
You can't keep the drones.

565
00:21:20,748 --> 00:21:22,248
So, how was your date
with Brad?

566
00:21:22,342 --> 00:21:24,115
It wasn't a date.
We were just having lunch.

567
00:21:24,163 --> 00:21:25,964
You guys are getting
back together, aren't you?

568
00:21:26,011 --> 00:21:27,568
Morty, I need your help
on an adventure.

569
00:21:27,615 --> 00:21:28,810
Eh, "need"
is a strong word.

570
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,754
We need door stops,
but a brick would work, too.

571
00:21:30,802 --> 00:21:32,652
Okay.

572
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,902
Morty.

573
00:21:35,675 --> 00:21:36,980
Good to have you back.

574
00:21:38,747 --> 00:21:40,253
Have you ever been peed on
before?

575
00:21:40,301 --> 00:21:41,817
