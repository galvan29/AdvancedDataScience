1
00:00:00,334 --> 00:00:03,202
Learning to fly this thing,
Morty, is gonna be really liberating.

2
00:00:03,237 --> 00:00:05,830
You know, you're gonna be free to
go on all kinds of errands for me.

3
00:00:05,855 --> 00:00:07,440
- Cool.
- See that planet right there?

4
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:08,741
Don't fly too close
to that planet.

5
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:10,895
Someone will come out and try
to wash your windshield.

6
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:13,546
Hold on.

7
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,114
Yeah?
Yeah, I have it.

8
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:16,449
Where do you want to meet?

9
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:17,483
All right, cool.

10
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:18,818
All right, Morty,
lesson's over.

11
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,419
We got some business
to attend to

12
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:21,554
a few light minutes
south of here.

13
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:23,122
Oh, you still use
south in space?

14
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:25,491
Whoa! Jesus, Jerry!
What the hell are you doing here?!

15
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:26,692
What are you talking about?

16
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:28,494
We agreed a boy's father
should be present

17
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,930
- when he's learning to drive.
- I guess I remember that.

18
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:32,965
Wow. And you've just been back
there this whole time?

19
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,533
Amazing.

20
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:36,102
Well, we don't have time to
take him to earth, Morty.

21
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:38,371
Head for 3924917.

22
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:39,705
Cool!

23
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,074
Looks like I'm coming along
for an adventure!

24
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:43,809
Yep.

25
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:48,047
- This is where we're going?
- Nope.

26
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:49,482
This is.

27
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:50,883
You can park in a handicap
spot, Morty.

28
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:55,087
Anything with less than eight limbs
is considered disabled here.

29
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:02,361
Well, look at this fella.
Aren't you handsome?

30
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:03,529
Thank you.

31
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,931
- I'm Jerry.
- Oh, I know you are.

32
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:08,668
Did you come here in a
spaceship?

33
00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:11,237
I'm traveling with my son and
father-in-law.

34
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:12,438
W-wait. Are they coming?

35
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:13,973
Oh, they'll be back soon.

36
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:15,107
What?!

37
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:19,945
I don't know how this works!

38
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:20,613
Help me!

39
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:22,348
What the hell?!

40
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:23,749
I know, right?

41
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:25,117
Oh, what the hell?!

42
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:26,519
I know, right?

43
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:27,687
Jerryboree!?

44
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:29,622
You created a day care for my
dad?

45
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:31,490
Are you kidding?
I wish I had this idea.

46
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:32,992
Well, I did have this idea,

47
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:35,461
but I wish I was the version
of me that owned it.

48
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:36,962
That guy's rich.

49
00:01:36,997 --> 00:01:38,831
Don't forget to check the
reason for your drop-off.

50
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:41,233
Trust me, Morty, I've heard
stories from other Ricks.

51
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,869
Jerrys don't tend to last five
minutes off of earth.

52
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:46,739
This is a totally unregistered
cross-temporal asteroid.

53
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,408
Here, they can romp and play
with other Jerrys.

54
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:50,543
He couldn't be safer.

55
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:52,278
Hey, Morty, hang on to this.

56
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:53,846
That number's your dad.

57
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,082
If you lose it, we're not
gonna be able to get him back.

Oh, hi, Morty.
I'm Krombopulos Michael.

I'm an assassin.
I buy guns from your grandpa.

Here. Go away.

Ooh! Yeah, this looks deadly.
So, this shoots antimatter?

83
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:21,333
My target can't be killed with
regular matter.

84
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:22,635
Nice to meet you, Morty.

I have no code of ethics.

88
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,341
I will kill anyone, anywhere

00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:32,344
children, animals, old people
doesn't matter.

I just love killing.

91
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,881
You sell weapons to killers
for money?

92
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,050
You've got what the
intergalactic call

93
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:39,685
a very planetary mind-set, Morty.

94
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,587
It's more complicated out here.

95
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:42,855
These are flerbos.

96
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,857

Oh, this place is the best.

100
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,667
It's got beer, games, prizes,

101
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,435
and you can never
tell what time it is.

102
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:59,271
You sold a gun to a murderer
so you could play video games?!

103
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:02,341
Yeah, sure, I mean, if you spend
all day shuffling words around,

104
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,310
you can make anything
sound bad, Morty.

105
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,212
Here, check this out.

106
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:09,315
Aah!

107
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,349
Roy, what's wrong?

108
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:11,650
I had a nightmare.

109
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:15,688
I was with an old man.
He put a helmet on me.

110
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,790
It's just a fever.
Get some sleep.

111
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:20,759
I don't want you missing
school on Monday.

112
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:24,530
I want you kids to look
around you today

113
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,065
and think about your future.

114
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,967
Now is the time in your life
when anything is possible.

115
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,735
Spiraling perfectly!

116
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,470
It's gonna be caught
by Roy Parsons!

117
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:33,706
Roy Parsons is at the 20!
Now he's at the 10!

118
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,307
Nothing can stop Roy
"the Rocket"!

119
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:37,276
Touchdown!

120
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,411
I just think it's time
to get realistic.

121
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:42,314
Have you talked to my father
about the carpet store?

122
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:44,016
Roy?

123
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:49,822
Had we caught it sooner well,
hindsight is 20/20, Roy.

124
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:52,358
What's important is that we
move quickly.

125
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,594
I'm not ready to die.

126
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,129
You're not going to.

127
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:03,002
- Yeah! Whoo!
- Yeah!

128
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:07,706
Hey, thanks for
the carpet, Roy.

129
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:12,511
Hey, Roy, you pulled
those persian off-white shags

130
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:14,213
for the clearance sale?

131
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:18,751
Whoa. Sh shit!

132
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:20,219
Oh!

133
00:05:21,264 --> 00:05:22,331
Whoa!
What the hell?!

134
00:05:22,365 --> 00:05:23,399
W-w-where am I?!

135
00:05:23,433 --> 00:05:25,034
- What in the hell?!
- 55 years. Not bad, Morty.

136
00:05:25,068 --> 00:05:26,835
You kind of wasted
your 30s, though,

137
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,203
with that whole
bird-watching phase.

138
00:05:28,238 --> 00:05:30,472
- Where's my wife?!
- Morty, you were just playing a game.

139
00:05:30,507 --> 00:05:31,273
It's called "Roy".

140
00:05:31,307 --> 00:05:32,608
Snap out of it. Come on.

141
00:05:32,642 --> 00:05:34,243
I'm Morty. You're Rick.

142
00:05:34,277 --> 00:05:36,311
Hey! You sold a gun to a guy
that kills people!

143
00:05:36,346 --> 00:05:37,980
Look at this you beat cancer,

144
00:05:38,014 --> 00:05:39,615
and then you went back to work
at the carpet store?

145
00:05:39,649 --> 00:05:40,749
Boo!

146
00:05:40,784 --> 00:05:42,351
D-don't dodge the issue, Rick!

147
00:05:42,385 --> 00:05:45,087
Selling a gun to a hit man is the
same as pulling the trigger!

148
00:05:45,121 --> 00:05:46,622
It's also the same
as doing nothing.

149
00:05:46,656 --> 00:05:48,357
If Krombopulos Michael wants
someone dead,

150
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:50,059
there's not a lot anyone can
do to stop him.

151
00:05:50,093 --> 00:05:51,593
That's why he does
it for a living.

152
00:05:51,628 --> 00:05:54,296
Now excuse me. It's time to
thrash your "Roy" score.

153
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,398
You know, you could stop this
killing from happening, Rick!

154
00:05:56,433 --> 00:05:58,300
You know, you did a bad thing
selling that gun,

155
00:05:58,334 --> 00:05:59,902
but you could undo
it if you wanted.

156
00:05:59,936 --> 00:06:02,538
Uh-huh, yeah, that's the difference
between you and me, Morty.

157
00:06:02,572 --> 00:06:05,140
- I never go back to the carpet store.
- Holy shit!

158
00:06:05,175 --> 00:06:07,242
This guy's taking Roy off the grid!

159
00:06:07,277 --> 00:06:10,846
This guy doesn't have a social
security number for Roy!

160
00:06:15,852 --> 00:06:17,086
Hi. I'm sorry.

161
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,620
I think there was a
misunderstanding.

162
00:06:18,655 --> 00:06:20,495
I'm an adult and would like to
go home, please.

163
00:06:20,523 --> 00:06:23,759
Well, of course.
Right through that tube.

164
00:06:23,793 --> 00:06:26,028
Unbelievable.

165
00:06:26,796 --> 00:06:28,363
You're doing great.

166
00:06:28,398 --> 00:06:30,566
I know how to crawl in a tube.

167
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,334
Come on.

168
00:06:32,368 --> 00:06:33,735
Oh.

169
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,370
This is harder than it looks.

170
00:06:35,405 --> 00:06:37,606
Whoa!

171
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,174
- Marco?
- Polo!

172
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:40,509
Marco?

173
00:06:40,543 --> 00:06:41,844
Come find me.

174
00:06:41,878 --> 00:06:43,112

175
00:06:43,146 --> 00:06:44,847
You guys are enjoying this?

00:06:44,881 --> 00:06:46,548
Don't you feel a little
patronized?

177
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:47,549
How so?

178
00:06:47,584 --> 00:06:48,951
- Jerry!
- Beth.

179
00:06:48,985 --> 00:06:50,619
Oh, come on.
This is ridiculous.

180
00:06:50,653 --> 00:06:53,222
I love you, Jerry.

181
00:06:53,256 --> 00:06:54,423
Aw, Beth.

182
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:57,259
Who wants to come watch
"midnight run"

183
00:06:57,293 --> 00:06:59,695
with director's commentary on?

184
00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:01,230
- Yeah!
- Definitely.

185
00:07:01,264 --> 00:07:04,266
First one there gets to adjust
the picture setting!

186
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,902
The factory tint
setting is always too high!

187
00:07:06,936 --> 00:07:09,671
Out of my way.
The tint setting is always too high.

188
00:07:12,876 --> 00:07:16,111
♪

189
00:07:23,753 --> 00:07:26,155
Oh, boy.
Here I go killing again.

190
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,060
Aah!

191
00:07:33,596 --> 00:07:35,230
Aah!

192
00:07:38,701 --> 00:07:40,335
Arh!

193
00:07:43,173 --> 00:07:44,339
Aah!

194
00:07:46,843 --> 00:07:49,011
Aah!

195
00:07:59,556 --> 00:08:03,292
<i>You have arrived at
Krombopulos Michael.</i>

196
00:08:03,326 --> 00:08:05,027
<i>Your destination is below.</i>

197
00:08:05,061 --> 00:08:08,931
We're all out of off-white
Persian.

198
00:08:08,965 --> 00:08:10,999
Oh, man!
W-w-what have I done?!

199
00:08:11,034 --> 00:08:12,434
- Drop the gun.
- You don't understand!

200
00:08:12,468 --> 00:08:15,704
- This guy was gonna kill someone!
- I guess that makes two of us.

201
00:08:16,773 --> 00:08:18,774
Aah!

202
00:08:18,808 --> 00:08:20,008
What are you doing, Morty?

203
00:08:20,043 --> 00:08:21,376
This is a galactic
federation outpost!

204
00:08:21,411 --> 00:08:23,445
Look, I don't have time to
tell you my entire backstory,

205
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:25,647
but grandpa and government
don't get along.

206
00:08:25,682 --> 00:08:26,949
He saved my life.

207
00:08:26,983 --> 00:08:28,383
- What?
- Huh?! Whoa!

208
00:08:28,418 --> 00:08:31,019
Are you Krombopulos Michael's
target?

209
00:08:31,054 --> 00:08:32,221
W-what's your name?

210
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,323
My kind has no use for names.

211
00:08:34,357 --> 00:08:37,826
I communicate through what
you call "Jessica's feet"

212
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,761
no, "telepathy".

213
00:08:39,796 --> 00:08:40,862
Oh, good job, Morty.

214
00:08:40,897 --> 00:08:42,297
Y-you killed my best customer,

215
00:08:42,332 --> 00:08:44,233
but you saved a
mind-reading fart.

216
00:08:44,267 --> 00:08:46,068
I like this name fart.

217
00:08:46,102 --> 00:08:48,237
Morty, would you kindly
release me

218
00:08:48,271 --> 00:08:50,739
by pulling that lever to the
left of my cell?

219
00:08:50,773 --> 00:08:52,574
I am in great pain.

220
00:08:52,609 --> 00:08:54,543
Morty, don't do it.

221
00:08:54,577 --> 00:08:56,378
Morty...

222
00:08:56,412 --> 00:08:58,080
Morty, you idiot.

223
00:08:58,114 --> 00:08:59,481
Oh, crap.
Let's get you out of here!

224
00:08:59,515 --> 00:09:01,283
We can't get him out of here.
He's gaseous.

225
00:09:01,317 --> 00:09:03,285
He's not gonna make it through
a portal, Morty.

226
00:09:03,319 --> 00:09:05,120
Well, then, I guess we're all
getting in the car.

227
00:09:05,154 --> 00:09:06,688
- Right, uh...
- Fart.

228
00:09:06,723 --> 00:09:09,124
- No! Just just get in the car!
- Morty, come on.

229
00:09:09,158 --> 00:09:10,125
I want to go back to
Blips and Chitz.

230
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:11,426
I don't want to deal with this.

231
00:09:11,461 --> 00:09:13,095
Rick, you've been
clear on the fact

232
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:14,763
that you don't want to help,
so just go away.

233
00:09:14,797 --> 00:09:16,231
More are coming.

234
00:09:16,266 --> 00:09:17,766
Screw this.
I'm out.

235
00:09:21,037 --> 00:09:24,506
Whoa!
Come on, come on!

236
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,643
Get out of the vehicle made of
garbage or we will open fire!

237
00:09:28,745 --> 00:09:29,645
Um, um, um, um!

238
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:31,380
Open fire!

239
00:09:31,414 --> 00:09:32,681
Aah!

240
00:09:41,324 --> 00:09:44,526
Stupid-ass, fart-saving,
carpet-store mother[bleep].

241
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,794
Move!

242
00:09:45,828 --> 00:09:47,796
Wait, did you [bleep]
with my seat settings?

243
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:52,567
More are coming.

244
00:09:52,602 --> 00:09:54,002
Rick!

245
00:09:54,037 --> 00:09:55,570
Yeah, yeah.

246
00:10:02,783 --> 00:10:04,818
Your geldon convertor is
pretty dinged up.

247
00:10:04,852 --> 00:10:07,721
That's because my grandson
drives like a male Obravadian.

248
00:10:07,755 --> 00:10:10,590
Yeah, I said it some
stereotypes are based in fact.

249
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,592
Actually, it's because of
years of neglect.

250
00:10:12,627 --> 00:10:14,928
You really need to respect
your gears, Rick.

251
00:10:14,962 --> 00:10:16,963
To you, they're just
wheels with teeth,

252
00:10:16,998 --> 00:10:19,265
but in my culture, wars have
been fought--

253
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,667
So I've heard.
Just fix it.

254
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:22,802
I don't think the gromflamites
can track us now,

255
00:10:22,837 --> 00:10:24,938
but it looks like we're gonna
be here for a while.

256
00:10:24,972 --> 00:10:27,807
Or, you know, if you still have
that gun K. Michael dropped,

257
00:10:27,842 --> 00:10:29,843
we could finish the job
and go home.

258
00:10:29,877 --> 00:10:32,712
- You do understand I'm telepathic, right?
- I'm being polite.

259
00:10:32,747 --> 00:10:34,781
Rick, we're taking him back
where he belongs.

260
00:10:34,815 --> 00:10:36,149
Oh, yeah? Where's that?

261
00:10:36,183 --> 00:10:37,751
Are you going on a quest to
find he who smelt it?

262
00:10:37,785 --> 00:10:40,053
I came here accidentally
through a wormhole

263
00:10:40,087 --> 00:10:43,490
located in what you call
"Get out of my head, fart.

264
00:10:43,524 --> 00:10:45,692
I know you're in here.
La-la-la-la".

265
00:10:45,726 --> 00:10:48,395
No, in what you call the
Promethean Nebula.

266
00:10:48,429 --> 00:10:51,698
Oh, great. Just a hop, skip,
and an 800-light-year jump.

267
00:10:51,732 --> 00:10:53,933
You know, you can leave
anytime you want, Rick.

268
00:10:53,968 --> 00:10:56,136
Whatever you want to do,
you little punk-ass little bitch.

269
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,537
Thank you, Morty.

270
00:10:57,571 --> 00:11:00,006
You are not like other
carbon-based life-forms.

271
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,676
You put the value of all life
above your own.

272
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:05,245
It's how things should be.
It's how they could be.

273
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,681

This isn't a musical number.

287
00:12:01,902 --> 00:12:03,636
This is a [bleep] operation.

288
00:12:03,671 --> 00:12:05,872
We got to be cool and [bleep]
lay low.

289
00:12:08,676 --> 00:12:10,510
Duck, duck, birdie?

290
00:12:11,612 --> 00:12:13,780
That's very funny!

291
00:12:13,814 --> 00:12:15,381
Here comes another funny.

292
00:12:18,385 --> 00:12:19,919
Oh, this place is great.

293
00:12:19,954 --> 00:12:22,489
I almost wish I could stay
longer than one day.

294
00:12:22,523 --> 00:12:24,157
You just might.

295
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:26,059
W-what do you mean?

296
00:12:26,093 --> 00:12:29,562
These are the Jerrys whose Ricks
and Mortys never came back.

297
00:12:33,868 --> 00:12:35,502
They live here now.

298
00:12:35,536 --> 00:12:37,270
Uh.

299
00:12:48,516 --> 00:12:50,717
No gear-turnings as of yet in
the curious case

300
00:12:50,751 --> 00:12:52,919
of these unidentified
humanoid fugitives,

301
00:12:52,953 --> 00:12:55,722
reportedly at large somewhere
within the gear system.

302
00:12:55,756 --> 00:12:56,990
Son of a...

303
00:12:57,024 --> 00:12:58,992
Why were the gromflamites
holding you prisoner?

304
00:12:59,026 --> 00:13:00,794
What the [bleep] is so
valuable about you?

305
00:13:00,828 --> 00:13:03,062
I am no more valuable
than life itself.

306
00:13:03,097 --> 00:13:06,466
However, I am able to alter
the composition of atoms,

307
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,734
like this.

308
00:13:09,069 --> 00:13:10,403
That was oxygen.

309
00:13:10,437 --> 00:13:12,572
I added 71 protons to it.

310
00:13:12,606 --> 00:13:15,241
Terrific.
The fart that pooped gold.

311
00:13:15,276 --> 00:13:17,744
No wonder every cop in the
system is looking for us.

312
00:13:17,778 --> 00:13:19,646
Any species that gets
ahold of this thing

313
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,080
is gonna use it to
take over the galaxy.

314
00:13:21,115 --> 00:13:23,449
You know how inconvenient
that's gonna be to my work?

315
00:13:26,754 --> 00:13:28,922
Somebody dropped
the dime on us.

316
00:13:28,956 --> 00:13:29,689
Gearhead!

317
00:13:29,723 --> 00:13:30,924
I'm sorry, Rick.

318
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:33,393
The reward on your
head is too high.

319
00:13:33,427 --> 00:13:34,661
And like you always say,

320
00:13:34,695 --> 00:13:36,763
you got to look out
for number one.

321
00:13:36,797 --> 00:13:39,833
Number one is me, asshole!
You're supposed to be my friend!

322
00:13:39,867 --> 00:13:42,535
Friend?! Do you even
know my real name?

323
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:45,238
It's Revolio Clockberg Junior.

324
00:13:45,272 --> 00:13:48,341
I belong to an entire species
of gear people.

325
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:52,445
Calling me "gearhead" is like calling
a Chinese person "Asia face".

326
00:13:52,479 --> 00:13:54,380
No! Not twigs!

327
00:13:57,484 --> 00:14:00,653
Two things I want to make
clear to everybody in this room

328
00:14:00,688 --> 00:14:03,356
never betray me,
and it's time to go.

329
00:14:08,095 --> 00:14:08,928
Nobody move!

330
00:14:10,497 --> 00:14:13,032
Oh, my god.
Are those...

331
00:14:15,336 --> 00:14:18,004
♪

332
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,921
Hey, Morty, remember
when you said

333
00:14:34,955 --> 00:14:36,789
selling a gun was as bad as
pulling the trigger?

334
00:14:36,824 --> 00:14:38,258
How do you feel about all
these people

335
00:14:38,292 --> 00:14:40,560
that are getting killed today
because of your choices?

336
00:14:40,594 --> 00:14:41,995
I did the right thing, Rick!

337
00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:43,796
- Tell that to gearhead's gearsticles.
- You did that!

338
00:14:43,831 --> 00:14:46,399
Wrong! I'd be playing "Roy"
right now.

339
00:14:46,433 --> 00:14:48,902
At a certain point,
my hands are tied, Morty.

340
00:14:51,972 --> 00:14:53,539
I can't believe Rick did this.

341
00:14:53,574 --> 00:14:55,842
- This is the eighth to the last straw.
- Ante up.

342
00:14:55,876 --> 00:14:57,210
You know what?
Screw it!

343
00:14:57,244 --> 00:14:59,379
I have a better
gamble for you guys.

344
00:14:59,413 --> 00:15:01,347
I say we escape.

345
00:15:01,382 --> 00:15:04,417
If you want to leave, you can
just go out the front door.

346
00:15:04,451 --> 00:15:06,653
You think we're kept here
against our will?

347
00:15:06,687 --> 00:15:08,154
That would be illegal.

348
