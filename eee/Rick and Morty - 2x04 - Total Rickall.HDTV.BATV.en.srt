1
00:00:03,135 --> 00:00:06,872
Steve, I just got a weird e-mail.
Did you buy us airline tickets?

2
00:00:06,874 --> 00:00:08,808
Aw, shoot. It was supposed
to be a surprise.

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:11,878
I wanted to thank you for letting
me live here all this time,

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,713
so I'm treating the family
to a vacation!

5
00:00:13,715 --> 00:00:15,014
Steve, you're so sweet.

6
00:00:15,016 --> 00:00:16,949
- Thanks, uncle Steve!
- Best uncle ever!

7
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:18,217
Look out, world.

8
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:19,919
The Smith family
is going to Paris!

9
00:00:19,921 --> 00:00:21,387
Yeah! Awesome!

10
00:00:21,389 --> 00:00:24,589
Rick, I don't like glowing rocks
in the kitchen trash!

11
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:28,060
Well, I don't like your unemployed
genes in my grandchildren, Jerry,

12
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:30,129
but life is made
of little concessions.

13
00:00:30,131 --> 00:00:31,264
I--
You know what?

14
00:00:31,266 --> 00:00:32,965
You're gonna land
on your feet, Jer.

15
00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:34,901
Some company out there's
gonna thank their lucky stars

16
00:00:34,903 --> 00:00:36,569
they hired my little brother.

17
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:39,105
- Who the [bleep] are you?
- My goofy brother, Steve.

18
00:00:39,107 --> 00:00:41,574
He's been
living here almost a year now.

19
00:00:41,576 --> 00:00:42,809
Are you losing your mind?

20
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:46,145
Hey, someone's been spending too
much time around glowing rocks.

21
00:00:46,147 --> 00:00:47,713
Am I right?

22
00:00:48,917 --> 00:00:50,750
- Oh, my god!
- Call an ambulance!

23
00:00:50,752 --> 00:00:53,085
- Oh, god! Steve!
- What the hell, Rick?!

24
00:00:53,087 --> 00:00:54,587
Will everybody just relax
for a second?

25
00:00:54,589 --> 00:00:56,088
There's no such thing
as an "uncle Steve".

26
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,591
That is an alien parasite.

27
00:00:59,661 --> 00:01:02,261
- But I've known him my whole life.
- No, you haven't, Jerry.

28
00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:05,398
These telepathic little bastards,
they embed themselves in memories,

29
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,935
and then they use those to multiply
and spread out, take over planets.

30
00:01:08,937 --> 00:01:10,303
It's--
It's disgusting.

31
00:01:10,305 --> 00:01:12,698
- Steve wasn't real?
- He's a real piece of shit.

32
00:01:12,723 --> 00:01:13,520
This is a big one.

33
00:01:13,545 --> 00:01:15,179
Somebody probably
tracked it in last week

34
00:01:15,204 --> 00:01:17,176
on the bottom of their shoe on
a piece of alien fruit.

35
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:19,045
- Someone?
- Get off the high road, Summer.

36
00:01:19,047 --> 00:01:22,014
We all got pink eye because you
won't stop texting on the toilet.

37
00:01:22,016 --> 00:01:24,116
But uncle Steve taught me
how to ride a bike!

38
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:25,785
No, "Steve" put that memory
in your brain

39
00:01:25,787 --> 00:01:28,421
so he could live in your house,
eat your food, and multiply.

40
00:01:28,423 --> 00:01:30,256
We could be infested
with these things.

41
00:01:30,258 --> 00:01:32,124
So we got to keep an eye out

42
00:01:32,126 --> 00:01:34,260
for any zany, wacky
characters that pop up.

43
00:01:34,262 --> 00:01:35,361
Ooh, whee!

44
00:01:35,363 --> 00:01:37,096
Whatever you want, Rick!
We're here to help!

00:01:37,098 --> 00:01:41,367

Jerry, buttons don't work better
if you hit them harder,

and foam fists
don't make you strong.

I know.
Friends make you strong.

00:02:55,677 --> 00:02:57,843
I watched
the same musical you did.

00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,779
Why couldn't I bring
my portal gun?

64
00:02:59,781 --> 00:03:02,748
Why did all the
drinks have to be extra large?

65
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,283
Oh, the hulk.
I just got that.

66
00:03:04,285 --> 00:03:07,053
Just pee your pants.
I did it the minute we got stuck.

Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, shame me.

68
00:03:08,923 --> 00:03:11,624

it's on purpose.

Oh, y'all,
we're gonna be fine.

70
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:16,796
I've always been here for
you guys, and I always will be.

71
00:03:16,798 --> 00:03:20,132
Somebody call for repairs?

72
00:03:20,134 --> 00:03:21,601
Yay! Cousin Nicky!

73
00:03:21,603 --> 00:03:22,902
It's me, cousin Nicky.

00:03:22,904 --> 00:03:24,870
I'm walkin' here!
I mean, I'm not.

75
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:29,542
I'm crouched in the elevator shaft,
but hey, I'm walkin' here!

76
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,311
It's true.

77
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:34,780
We really do get into some
crazy situations as a family,

78
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:37,049
mostly when
we're cooped up like this.

79
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:39,118
Hey, maybe Mr. Poopypants
is right.

80
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,419
Let's get some fresh air.

81
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:41,954
Come on, cousin Nicky.
You heard Rick.

82
00:03:41,956 --> 00:03:43,422
We have to stay quarantined

83
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:45,458
until we know that there's
no more of these things.

84
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,559
I hear you, Morty.

85
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:48,294
Back in Brooklyn,
we got a sayin'--

86
00:03:48,296 --> 00:03:50,496
"We're walkin' here!"

87
00:03:50,498 --> 00:03:51,831
Nicky, get--

88
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,065
Oh!

89
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:54,834
What the...?

90
00:03:54,836 --> 00:03:56,602
Cousin Nicky was a parasite?!

91
00:03:56,604 --> 00:03:58,571
Six, Morty!
There's supposed to be six of us!

92
00:03:58,573 --> 00:04:00,940
If there's seven, then
that means somebody's not real.

93
00:04:00,942 --> 00:04:02,341
But how did you know
it was Nicky?

94
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:04,143
I guessed. That's why I aimed
for his shoulder.

95
00:04:04,145 --> 00:04:06,078
So we can't trust
any of our memories now?

96
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,481
Nicky was the reason we found
that old Nazi submarine.

97
00:04:08,483 --> 00:04:09,682
Did that not even happen?

98
00:04:09,684 --> 00:04:11,617
Well, of course it happened.

99
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:14,987
Now that I possess
the mighty staff of rah-gubaba,

100
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:18,024
the world will tremble
before the Fourth Reich!

101
00:04:18,026 --> 00:04:21,627
This is the last time I ask <i>you</i> for
help on my history final, Rick.

102
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:24,330
Hey, we got a word for Nazis
back in Brooklyn, pal.

103
00:04:24,332 --> 00:04:26,298
I'm comfortable being
called a Nazi.

104
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,335
You think there's some other
word that will hurt my feelings?

105
00:04:29,337 --> 00:04:31,971
Yeah.
Think before you talk shit.

106
00:04:31,973 --> 00:04:35,007
Rah-gubaba,
help me kill America!

107
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:37,143
Mr. Beauregard!

108
00:04:37,145 --> 00:04:41,814
After due consideration,
I have elected not to retire.

109
00:04:41,816 --> 00:04:43,449
Yeah!
Oh, thank god!

110
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:46,952
Now, I believe someone
has a final exam to attend.

111
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:49,455
Set a course
for Morty's high school.

112
00:04:49,457 --> 00:04:52,124
Perhaps I'm biased, but if
that story never happened,

113
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:54,293
then I wouldn't still be
the family butler.

114
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:55,861
Dare to dream.

115
00:04:55,863 --> 00:04:57,463
Wait.

116
00:04:57,465 --> 00:04:59,365
And if Mr. Beauregard
wasn't our butler,

117
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:03,002
it's safe to say the family'd be
in a <i>hell</i> of a lot of trouble.

118
00:05:03,004 --> 00:05:05,004
No! Don't flashback!

119
00:05:05,006 --> 00:05:06,706
You're just gonna make
more swelling.

120
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:08,074
- Just relax.
- Don't worry, Jerry.

121
00:05:08,076 --> 00:05:09,108
We called the fire department.

122
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,077
You know they won't come here anymore.

123
00:05:13,815 --> 00:05:15,014
Marmalade is served!

124
00:05:15,016 --> 00:05:16,682
Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!

125
00:05:16,684 --> 00:05:18,150
Oh, whee!

126
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:20,986
I guess I take back what I said
about British cuisine.

127
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,523
Take that, Summer!

128
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:25,991
We're trying to sleep.

129
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,860
I don't want
to go to the dance alone.

130
00:05:27,862 --> 00:05:31,264
Then perhaps you shouldn't.

131
00:05:31,366 --> 00:05:33,466
Aww.
Mr. Beauregard.

132
00:05:33,568 --> 00:05:36,936
- Shall we, master Morty?
- We shall.

133
00:05:36,938 --> 00:05:39,004

don't leave without letting

136
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:48,047
These parasites
are like bed bugs,

137
00:05:48,049 --> 00:05:50,216
and every flashback
is another mattress. Look!

138
00:05:50,218 --> 00:05:52,785
There's only supposed to be
six people in this house.

139
00:05:52,787 --> 00:05:54,253
But there's always been 10.

140
00:05:54,255 --> 00:05:55,421
No!

141
00:05:55,423 --> 00:05:56,889
Uh, the fact
that I wrote this number down

142
00:05:56,891 --> 00:05:58,057
means that
there's four parasites.

143
00:05:58,059 --> 00:05:59,358
You sure about that, Rick?

144
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,026
Begging your pardon,
master Rick,

145
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:03,062
but I seem to recall
a great deal of confusion

146
00:06:03,064 --> 00:06:04,263
surrounding that number.

147
00:06:04,265 --> 00:06:05,531
All right, there's six of us.

148
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:06,932
And that's it.

149
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:09,435
Me, Morty, Jerry,
Beth, Mr. Poopybutthole,

150
00:06:09,437 --> 00:06:11,937
Frankenstein, Sleepy Gary,
photography Raptor,

151
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:13,372
Mr. Beauregard, and Summer.

152
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:15,241
Uh, dad,
that's like 10 people.

153
00:06:15,243 --> 00:06:17,209
6, 10, what's the difference?

154
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:19,745
I just love the number 6
for no reason!

155
00:06:19,747 --> 00:06:21,046
Where's my pencil at?

156
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:24,216
- Here, Rick! Use me!
- Oh, thanks, Pencilvester!

157
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,318
Yeah, I guess that
is what happened,

158
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,254
but I don't get
why I would do that.

159
00:06:28,256 --> 00:06:30,055
Everybody makes mistakes, Rick.

160
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:31,991
Why do you think
I have one of these?

161
00:06:34,095 --> 00:06:35,628
That's it.
Photos.

162
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,896
Hard evidence.

163
00:06:36,898 --> 00:06:39,665
You're not in any of my photos,
Mr. Poopybutthole.

164
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:41,667
Well, what do you know
about this?

165
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:44,170
You're not in any of mine.

166
00:06:44,172 --> 00:06:48,107
All I have are pictures of me
and my friends from school.

167
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:50,943
What? What teenage girl
has pictures of her family?

168
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:52,611
It's not like we're mormon
or dying.

169
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:55,781
I will admit it's suspicious
that Summer's only friend

170
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:58,818
is a magic ballerina lamb
that we've never seen.

171
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,452

Tinkles!

173
00:07:01,956 --> 00:07:04,123
It's past my bedtime.

174
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,192
Not in never past bedtime land!

175
00:07:06,194 --> 00:07:08,127
Here we go!

176
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:11,197

184
00:07:27,882 --> 00:07:31,084
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

185
00:07:31,786 --> 00:07:33,886
- Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
- Summer, we're trying to sleep.

186
00:07:33,888 --> 00:07:35,654
It was Tinkles!

187
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:36,689
Tinkles?

188
00:07:36,691 --> 00:07:38,324
That is su--
Suspicious.

189
00:07:38,326 --> 00:07:40,292
We're always hearing about
this Tinkles character,

190
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:41,994
- but we never get to--
- Hi, everybody.

191
00:07:41,996 --> 00:07:44,163
I'm Tinkles,
and these are my friends.

192
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,999
See, everyone?
Tinkles is real.

193
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:48,334
That means so am I.

194
00:07:48,336 --> 00:07:50,502
- Sorry, Summer.
- Man, I'm sorry, Summer.

195
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:53,239
I was on the wrong side
of the pitchfork on this one.

196
00:07:53,241 --> 00:07:56,008
Okay, look, we shouldn't need
evidence or logic

197
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,143
to know who's family
and who isn't.

198
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,678
I know who the Smiths are.

199
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,914
I've known Beth
since high school.

200
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:06,018
And her husband, Sleepy Gary, is
hands down my absolute best friend.

201
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,253
Thanks, Jerry.

202
00:08:07,255 --> 00:08:10,522
Beyond that, no offense to any
of you, but all bets are off.

203
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:12,858
Look, I'm not used to being
this unsure for this long.

204
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,727
I'm just gonna aim for shoulders
starting with the weird girl.

205
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:15,928
Aah!

206
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,997
- Grandpa Rick!
- Hold still, "Summer".

207
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:20,232
Rick, that is my daughter.

208
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:22,701
Oh, yeah? Well, what if you just
think that, Sleepy Gary?

209
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:25,204
I've known you for 15 years.
Don't make me hurt you.

210
00:08:25,206 --> 00:08:27,506
Rick, these are
our family and friends,

211
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:29,375
the people we barbecue with.

212
00:08:29,377 --> 00:08:31,377
Have you forgotten
the barbecue?

213
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:32,678
Wait, why would you want me to--

214
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,113
You're one of them, aren't you?

215
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:37,116
Rick. You love
those barbecues, Rick.

216
00:08:37,118 --> 00:08:38,684
You <i>love</i> them.
Hai!

217
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:39,718
Remember it, Rick?

218
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,288
Shut up, Hamurai!
Shut up, Amish Cyborg!

219
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,056
What is this?
'90s Conan?

220
00:08:44,058 --> 00:08:46,025
Remember the barbecue.

221
00:08:46,027 --> 00:08:47,359
Remember the barbecue.

222
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:48,894
Remember the barbecue.

223
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:51,263
You know what, Pencilvester?

224
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:53,399
It took me my whole life
to realize it,

225
00:08:53,401 --> 00:08:54,867
but I love barbecuing.

226
00:08:54,869 --> 00:08:56,702
- You're good at it, Rick.
- Watch me, baby.

227
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:58,737
I'm like Tom Cruise from,
um, "Cuisine"

228
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:01,540
or w-whatever that movie's
called where he makes drinks.

229
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:02,775
Yeah, check me out.

230
00:09:02,777 --> 00:09:04,743
I'm like Tom Cruise
from "Cuisine".

231
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:05,744
Yeah.

232
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:07,446
Is that what it's called?
"Cuisine"?

233
00:09:07,448 --> 00:09:08,814
Wow!
Hey, everybody.

234
00:09:08,816 --> 00:09:11,283
Let's give it up
for the grillmaster Rick!

235
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:12,484
Rick!
Rick! Rick!

236
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:17,957
Wait.

237
00:09:20,795 --> 00:09:22,094
Noooooo!

238
00:09:22,096 --> 00:09:23,295
Shoot. Now look.

239
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:25,731
It's like a "Where's Waldo?" page.
Can you find me?

240
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:27,266
Check out
all these zany characters.

241
00:09:27,268 --> 00:09:29,568
We'll be right back
after these messages.

242
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:32,572
I think you should
put down the gun

243
00:09:32,574 --> 00:09:33,907
and we should get you
to a doctor.

244
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:35,775
What do you say we take down
these blast shields?

245
00:09:35,777 --> 00:09:37,544
- Yeah.
- I can't do that, Sleepy Gary.

246
00:09:37,546 --> 00:09:38,845
All right,
everybody listen to me.

247
00:09:38,847 --> 00:09:40,547
I don't know
if any of you guys are real,

248
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:42,549
but this house has been infested
with fake loved ones

249
00:09:42,551 --> 00:09:43,950
that spread
through fake memories,

250
00:09:43,952 --> 00:09:45,952
and our planet will be destroyed
if they get out.

251
00:09:47,189 --> 00:09:51,458
But, Rick, even you have to admit
you do tend to overreact to stuff.

252
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,261
You guys, we got to hurry.
I just got back from Walmart.

253
00:09:54,263 --> 00:09:56,963
They're selling Nintendo 3DS
systems for $149.99 on sale,

254
00:09:56,965 --> 00:09:59,566
plus every time you buy one,
you get a $50 gift card.

255
00:09:59,568 --> 00:10:01,734
Brings the total price down
to $110 after tax.

256
00:10:01,736 --> 00:10:04,104
Now, listen, we can flip
those sons of bitches

257
00:10:04,106 --> 00:10:05,472
for 230 bucks apiece easy!

258
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:07,474
They're all limited-edition
"Zelda" ones.

259
00:10:07,476 --> 00:10:08,942
Hurry! Hurry!
Come with me!

260
00:10:08,944 --> 00:10:11,244
We can be rich,
and we also all get to keep one

261
00:10:11,246 --> 00:10:12,812
and we can play
Nintendo games!

262
00:10:12,814 --> 00:10:14,981
Nintendo, give me free stuff.

263
00:10:14,983 --> 00:10:17,484
Okay, yes,
I definitely remember doing that,

264
00:10:17,486 --> 00:10:19,319
but also,
I would never do that.

265
00:10:19,321 --> 00:10:20,787
Don't overreact, Rick.

266
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:23,056
- Sleepy Gary, a word?
- Sure, Jerry.

267
00:10:23,058 --> 00:10:24,657
Rick, keep a level head, okay?

268
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:27,427
'Cause I'll tell you a secret
about Frankenstein--

269
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:31,431
He's actually
Frankenstein's monster.

270
00:10:33,234 --> 00:10:36,803
Sleepy Gary, my head is filled
with memories of our friendship.

271
00:10:36,805 --> 00:10:40,507
I'm convinced that you're Beth's
husband and I'm your friend,

272
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:42,842
but if those memories
can't be trusted, then...

273
00:10:42,844 --> 00:10:43,943
Jerry, just say it.

274
00:10:43,945 --> 00:10:47,347
Sleepy Gary,
how do we know <i>I'm</i> real?

275
00:10:47,349 --> 00:10:48,848
Jesus, Jerry.

276
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:52,085
No, you're real.
Hey, look at me.

277
00:10:52,087 --> 00:10:53,753
Now, I don't know
which way is up out there,

278
00:10:53,755 --> 00:10:56,523
but I know us,
and you're real, Jerry.

279
00:10:56,525 --> 00:10:58,491
Remember our vacation?

280
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:03,295
They're filming that new
"Star Wars" movie down the coast.

281
00:11:03,297 --> 00:11:06,766
- Should we check it out?
- Sure. Why not?

282
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:16,409
Maybe we'll see Chewbacca.

283
00:11:16,811 --> 00:11:19,579
I'd like that.

284
00:11:25,486 --> 00:11:28,090
What are we doing?

285
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:35,728
I don't give a damn
what else happens out there.

286
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:38,631
You and I
are going to survive this.

287
00:11:38,633 --> 00:11:39,999
Okay.

288
00:11:40,001 --> 00:11:43,236
Hey, we agreed.
Never in the house.

289
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:47,573
That's a cool watch there, Rick.
Can I check it out?

290
00:11:47,575 --> 00:11:49,175
Uh, no thank--

291
00:11:49,177 --> 00:11:50,376
Okay.

292
00:11:50,378 --> 00:11:52,879
Trying to figure out how to
lower the blast shields, huh?

293
00:11:52,881 --> 00:11:54,614
Anybody here
think it's suspicious

294
00:11:54,616 --> 00:11:57,083
that a lot of people in here
can't wait to get <i>out</i> of here?

295
00:11:57,085 --> 00:12:00,753
Ah, you're paranoid, Rick.
You've been paranoid since 'nam.

296
00:12:00,755 --> 00:12:02,088
So, what are you gonna do

297
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,723
when you rotate back
to the world, Frankenstein?

298
00:12:03,725 --> 00:12:06,292
Shi-i-i-i-t.
I'mma bust a--

299
00:12:06,294 --> 00:12:08,728
No!
Get out of my head, parasite!

300
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:09,929
- No!
- Drop it.

301
00:12:09,931 --> 00:12:11,597
Give me the gun, Frankenstein!

302
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:15,701
Give it back!

303
00:12:15,703 --> 00:12:17,637
Yeah!

304
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:19,272
Frankenstein!

305
00:12:19,274 --> 00:12:21,140
Is anyone here even real?

306
00:12:21,142 --> 00:12:22,542
Am I the only real person
on Earth?!

307
00:12:22,544 --> 00:12:23,810
Maybe.

308
00:12:23,812 --> 00:12:25,945
Or maybe, just maybe,
we're all real.

309
00:12:25,947 --> 00:12:27,880
You know me.
I'm Reverse Giraffe.

310
00:12:27,882 --> 00:12:29,649
I have a short neck and legs.

311
00:12:29,651 --> 00:12:31,717
- I went to college with Hamurai.
- Hai!

312
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:33,820
I saved Ghost in a Jar's life
in Vietnam.

313
00:12:33,822 --> 00:12:35,988
- Boo rah!
- And, Beth, how many times

314
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,890
have I been a shoulder
for you to cry on?

315
00:12:37,892 --> 00:12:39,759
Too many.

316
00:12:39,761 --> 00:12:41,661
Okay,
so maybe we're just all fake.

317
00:12:41,663 --> 00:12:43,062
That don't make no sense!

318
00:12:43,064 --> 00:12:45,231
Or maybe there's only one
deceiver here--

319
00:12:45,233 --> 00:12:47,066
The person that
keeps telling us

320
00:12:47,068 --> 00:12:49,502
the path to salvation
is being held prisoner

321
00:12:49,504 --> 00:12:50,970
and mistrusting each other.

322
00:12:50,972 --> 00:12:52,305
Hey, don't blame me!

323
00:12:52,307 --> 00:12:53,906
I tried to shoot Summer
10 minutes ago!

324
00:12:53,908 --> 00:12:56,108
I know we all have
beloved memories of Rick,

325
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,077
but are we really
supposed to believe

326
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,980
that a mad scientist inventor
with a flying car

327
00:13:00,982 --> 00:13:04,517
just showed up on our doorstep
after being gone for years?

328
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:07,039
Yeah, you know, he does
have a lot of really weird,

329
00:13:07,064 --> 00:13:08,321
made-up sounding catchphrases.

330
00:13:08,423 --> 00:13:09,922
Wubba lubba dub dub!

331
00:13:09,924 --> 00:13:11,991
Ricky ticky tavi, beyotch!

332
00:13:11,993 --> 00:13:15,328
And that's the wa-a-a-a-y
the news goes.

333
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,562
Hit the sack, Jack.

334
00:13:16,564 --> 00:13:18,364
Uh-oh!
Somersault jump.

335
00:13:18,366 --> 00:13:19,832
AIDS!

336
00:13:19,834 --> 00:13:23,536
And that's why I always say
shum shum shlippedy dop!

337
00:13:23,538 --> 00:13:27,240
Grassss tastes bad-ah.

338
00:13:27,242 --> 00:13:28,941
No jumpin' in the sewer.

339
00:13:28,943 --> 00:13:29,942
Burger time!

340
00:13:29,944 --> 00:13:31,844
Rubber baby baby bunkers!

341
00:13:31,846 --> 00:13:34,013
Lick, lick, lick my balls!

342
00:13:34,015 --> 00:13:35,214
Yeah!

343
00:13:35,216 --> 00:13:36,549
Say that all the time.

344
00:13:37,852 --> 00:13:39,285
That's a fake-ass catchphrase
right there.

345
00:13:39,287 --> 00:13:41,754
Yeah, don't forget
his incredibly vague back story.

346
00:13:41,756 --> 00:13:43,356
Beth, I'm your father!

347
00:13:43,358 --> 00:13:44,624
Oh, are you, dad?
Are you?

348
00:13:44,626 --> 00:13:46,259
Rick, if you want
to prove you're real,

349
00:13:46,261 --> 00:13:48,628
just do what any of the rest
of us would do and--

350
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,564
And-- and open the blast shields
and let us the hell out of here!

351
00:13:51,566 --> 00:13:54,867
Why don't you make me,
implausibly naive pubescent boy

352
00:13:54,869 --> 00:13:57,403
with an old Jewish
comedy writer's name?

353
00:13:57,405 --> 00:13:58,771
Ooh! Ooh!
Ooh! Ooh!

354
00:13:58,773 --> 00:14:00,340
In your face!

355
00:14:00,342 --> 00:14:02,108
Give me the gun.

356
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:05,745
I'm not doing this
in front of Pencilvester.

357
00:14:05,747 --> 00:14:07,547
Bring him to the garage.

358
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:11,818
You listen to me, you
son of a bitch parasite scum.

359
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,253
We could either do this
the easy way or the hard way.

360
00:14:14,255 --> 00:14:15,721
You know, y-y-y--
Do you want to live?

361
00:14:15,723 --> 00:14:17,056
Then open
the blast shield doors.

362
00:14:17,058 --> 00:14:18,991
Shut up, Morty,
you brainwashed, little turd

363
00:14:18,993 --> 00:14:21,494
that might not even be real
because I'm brainwashed, too.

364
00:14:21,496 --> 00:14:23,095
You know, Rick,
this isn't easy for us.

365
00:14:23,097 --> 00:14:24,997
You know, w-we all remember you
as a friend.

366
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:26,632
Oh, oh, oh, really?

367
00:14:26,634 --> 00:14:28,668
Well, I remember you as a whiny,
little piece of shit, Morty!

368
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,936
- Oh-- oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

369
00:14:29,938 --> 00:14:31,504
I've got about a
thousand memories

370
00:14:31,506 --> 00:14:34,006
of your dumb, little ass and
about six of them are pleasant.

371
00:14:34,008 --> 00:14:35,641
The rest is annoying garbage.

372
00:14:35,643 --> 00:14:37,844
So why don't you do us both
a favor and pull the trigger?

373
00:14:37,846 --> 00:14:39,245
Do it!
Do it, mother[bleep]!

374
00:14:39,247 --> 00:14:41,648
Pull the [bleep] trigger!

375
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:44,684
Oh, wow.

376
00:14:44,686 --> 00:14:46,619
Baby wizard was a parasite?

377
00:14:46,621 --> 00:14:48,488
He set me up with my wife.

378
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,423
What the hell?

379
00:14:50,425 --> 00:14:51,958
I figured it out, Rick!

380
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,793
The parasites can only create
pleasant memories.

381
00:14:53,795 --> 00:14:57,830
I know you're real because I have
a ton of bad memories with you!

382
00:14:57,932 --> 00:15:02,669
♪ These memories that we have ♪

383

00:15:22,557 --> 00:15:24,657
Holy crap, Morty, you're right.

387
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:27,459
Isn't that what you were trying to
make me understand by yelling at me?

388
00:15:27,461 --> 00:15:31,698
Well, yeah, duh-doy.
Took you long enough.

389
00:15:33,835 --> 00:15:35,334
Now let's go, Morty.

390
00:15:35,336 --> 00:15:37,670
We got a lot of friends
and family to exterminate.

391
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,543
Everybody remain calm!
This is gonna take some explaining.

392
00:15:43,545 --> 00:15:46,245
We need to kill everyone that
we can only remember fondly.

393
00:15:46,247 --> 00:15:48,414
Who's got a bad memory
about Mrs. Refrigerator?

394
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,484
I-I-- everyone has
bad memories of me.

395
00:15:51,486 --> 00:15:53,419
You remember that one time?

396
00:15:57,425 --> 00:16:00,293
Ooh, man,
we couldn't stop screaming.

397
00:16:00,295 --> 00:16:03,863
Uh, roller coasters aren't bad,
Mrs. Refrigerator.

398
00:16:03,865 --> 00:16:05,364
They're thrilling.

399
00:16:05,366 --> 00:16:09,001
And you've been a perfect
companion to me my entire life.

400
00:16:09,003 --> 00:16:10,236
The jig is up!

401
00:16:10,238 --> 00:16:12,238
Get me out of here.

402
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,739
Get me out of here!

00:16:13,741 --> 00:16:15,241
Aah!

404
00:16:15,243 --> 00:16:17,009
Oh [bleep]!

405
00:16:17,011 --> 00:16:18,878
Everybody back!
If you're not a parasite,

406
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,913
you have nothing to fear.
So what about Summer?

407
00:16:20,915 --> 00:16:23,316
Why am I always your go-to?

408
00:16:26,287 --> 00:16:28,854
- Never go in my room again.
- I didn't!

409
00:16:28,856 --> 00:16:30,189
She's real.

410
00:16:30,191 --> 00:16:32,359
She's my bitch of a sister.

411
00:16:32,383 --> 00:16:33,560
Nice.

Hmm?
Yeah, yeah, yes. What time?

Oh, my god.
Are you drunk?

Thank you, sweetie.

Beth, Beth, please!

429

I thought it was too
good to be true

compatible kidneys.

an uncomfortable silence

or an awkward fart
on a road trip?

00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:29,849
Come on, Pencilvester.
Give me anything.

435
00:17:29,851 --> 00:17:31,183
Rick, I'm Pencilvester.

436
00:17:31,185 --> 00:17:33,419
Listen to that name.
You can't kill me.

You're right.

Why in the kitchen?!

00:18:13,127 --> 00:18:15,161
I do it everywhere!
Stop shaming me!

You're not the victim here!

I hate you, and I was thinking
about your friend Grace!

Aaaaaah!

447
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:27,239
Ah. Master Rick.

448
00:18:27,241 --> 00:18:29,842
Remember when you

Does that scan?

Oh, I get it.

452
00:18:36,884 --> 00:18:39,351
It's a play
on "The Butler did it."

453
00:18:39,353 --> 00:18:40,853
Thanks, Ghost in a Jar.

454
00:18:40,855 --> 00:18:44,091
You always were good at pointing
out potentially obscure comedy.

455

You got to hide me, Sleepy Gary.

456

Don't worry.
I have a plan.

If we can get to my boat,
there's a--

458
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,269
No. No!

459
00:18:57,271 --> 00:19:01,173
Just send me to Gary.
I want to be with Gary.

Whoa.
What the hell?

Look out for that homeless guy!

00:19:06,247 --> 00:19:08,347
Open the door!
Open the door!

464

There isn't time!
Just run!

00:19:10,885 --> 00:19:13,119
Get out here and help me!

466
00:19:13,121 --> 00:19:15,755
They say you shouldn't do that!
Just run!

467
00:19:15,857 --> 00:19:18,724
Ugh. Sorry, Jerry.
You're real.

468
00:19:18,726 --> 00:19:20,960
I'm a parasite!

469
00:19:20,962 --> 00:19:23,129
Yeah, but you're real.

00:19:23,131 --> 00:19:27,166
Uh, uh, I need time
to forget about Sleepy Gary.

we get back from outer space.

That goes for everyone.

475
00:19:37,812 --> 00:19:39,145
This is depressing.

00:19:51,926 --> 00:19:53,926
Will somebody
pass me a pork chop?

Wait, but I--

- Oh, Beth! Why?!
- I need an ambulance!

490
00:20:06,974 --> 00:20:08,440
There's been a shooting.
My wife shot...

It's not supposed to hurt.

I made a similar mistake
years ago,

but, you know,
on a planetary scale.

509
00:21:16,477 --> 00:21:20,079
- Is, um, is he mad at me?
- He's not pressing charges.

510
00:21:20,081 --> 00:21:22,681
I mean, that's got to be
the "you shot me" equivalent

511
00:21:22,683 --> 00:21:24,316
of not being mad.

512
00:21:24,318 --> 00:21:28,921
- Can he have visitors?
- He'd like to be alone.

513
00:21:28,923 --> 00:21:32,024
He told me
to tell you he's sorry

514
00:21:32,026 --> 00:21:34,159
you didn't have bad memories
