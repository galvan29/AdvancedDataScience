1
00:00:03,238 --> 00:00:05,738
Don't worry about Jerry.
He's gonna be fine.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,041
You hear me, Jerry?
You're gonna be fine.

3
00:00:08,043 --> 00:00:08,975
Whoa!

4
00:00:08,977 --> 00:00:10,310
Ooh, watch out for that stuff.

5
00:00:10,312 --> 00:00:12,078
It'll stain
if it gets on your clothes,

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,813
and it'll send you into
a murderous rage if it gets

7
00:00:13,815 --> 00:00:15,782
in your eyes and mouth. Why
would you keep mutant bacteria

8
00:00:15,784 --> 00:00:17,417
in a pint of cherry Garcia?

9
00:00:17,419 --> 00:00:19,619
I know this isn't the time,
but, you know, technically,

10
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:20,887
the second freezer drawer
is mine.

11
00:00:20,889 --> 00:00:22,722
- Not anymore.
- You're overreacting!

12
00:00:22,724 --> 00:00:24,891
We're losing him. All right, fine,
but you're not touching my crisper.

13
00:00:24,893 --> 00:00:26,659
- Is he going to die?
- Don't worry.

14
00:00:26,661 --> 00:00:28,628
Dr. glip glop
is the best in the galaxy.

15
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:30,630
Hello, I'm Dr. glip glop.

16
00:00:31,132 --> 00:00:32,999
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

17
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:34,601
-
- Aah!

18
00:00:36,104 --> 00:00:37,003
What?

19
00:00:37,005 --> 00:00:38,304
Every hospital claims to have

20
00:00:38,306 --> 00:00:39,939
the best doctor
in the ga--laxy.

21
00:00:39,941 --> 00:00:41,341
It's like those Pizza places

22
00:00:41,343 --> 00:00:43,109
that claim to have
the best Pizza in the world.

23
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:44,978
What do you think,
they have Pizza contests?

24
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,646
Have you ever been
to a Pizza contest?

25
00:00:46,648 --> 00:00:48,314
- Go in the waiting room, dad.
- Fine!

26
00:00:48,316 --> 00:00:50,183
Excuse me.

27
00:00:50,185 --> 00:00:51,784
Coming through.
What are you here for?

28
00:00:51,786 --> 00:00:53,019
Just kidding. I don't care.

29
00:00:53,021 --> 00:00:54,988
?

30
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,322
Well, this won't do.

31
00:00:56,324 --> 00:00:58,992
- Hey, what are you doing?
- A sequel.

32
00:00:58,994 --> 00:01:01,861
- I don't understand.
- Yeah, me, neither.

33
00:01:01,863 --> 00:01:03,830
We pretty much nailed it
the first time.

34
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:13,706
Biatch!

35
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:22,315
<i>Ooh! Ooh!</i>

36
00:01:22,317 --> 00:01:23,483
<i>Ow!</i>

37
00:01:23,485 --> 00:01:27,120
<i>"Man vs. Car,"
the newest hit show,</i>

38
00:01:27,122 --> 00:01:29,556
- where it pits a man...
- Yeah!

39
00:01:29,558 --> 00:01:31,958
Versus a car.

40
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,359
On tonight's episode,

41
00:01:33,361 --> 00:01:36,496
Michael Jenkins fights
a regular old car.

42
00:01:36,498 --> 00:01:37,697
Here we go.

43
00:01:37,699 --> 00:01:39,299
Oh, he's pushing
his way through.

44
00:01:39,301 --> 00:01:40,867
He's trying to fight that car,

45
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:42,368
but the car seems to have
the upper hand.

46
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:45,205
Oh, he's got a little bit
of pushback there.

47
00:01:45,207 --> 00:01:46,406
Oh, no.

48
00:01:46,408 --> 00:01:49,842
He just got ran over
and chewed up by the tires.

49
00:01:49,844 --> 00:01:52,845
I guess that's another one
for the cars.

50
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:56,649
I mean,
wouldn't the cars always win?

51
00:01:56,651 --> 00:01:58,051
?

52
00:01:58,053 --> 00:02:00,086
Samantha, I need to know,

53
00:02:00,088 --> 00:02:04,190
that you understand that
I have a couple of eyeholes.

54
00:02:04,192 --> 00:02:07,527
I do. I do understand
about your eyeholes.

55
00:02:07,529 --> 00:02:09,495
Here, look at my eyeholes.

56
00:02:09,497 --> 00:02:13,733
Oh, my God.
You have eight eye ho... holes.

57
00:02:15,036 --> 00:02:17,036
Ohh, I'm looking through
your eyeholes.

58
00:02:17,038 --> 00:02:19,872
Yes, look through my eyeholes.

59
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:27,080
<i>I'm the eyehole... Man.</i>

60
00:02:27,082 --> 00:02:31,451
<i>I'm the only one that's
allowed to have eye holes.</i>

61
00:02:31,453 --> 00:02:35,021
<i>Get up on out of here
with my eyeholes.</i>

62
00:02:35,023 --> 00:02:38,591
- Eyeholes. Get them today. Ikea...
- You got to be careful, Morty.

63
00:02:38,593 --> 00:02:40,893
If that guy catches you
with a box of his eyeholes,

64
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:42,395
he comes bursting in
through a window

65
00:02:42,397 --> 00:02:44,264
and just starts
kicking the shit out of you.

66
00:02:44,266 --> 00:02:45,932
But it's worth the risk.

67
00:02:45,934 --> 00:02:47,367
They melt in your mouth, Morty.
They're delicious.

68
00:02:47,369 --> 00:02:49,602
Dad, I can't believe
you're explaining alien cereal.

69
00:02:49,604 --> 00:02:52,272
- We're worried about Jerry.
- Well, you're 39 years too late,

70
00:02:52,274 --> 00:02:53,940
or, you know,
however old he is.

71
00:02:53,942 --> 00:02:55,241
Is he... is he 50?

72
00:02:55,243 --> 00:02:57,310
Jesus Christ, Beth,
is... is Jerry 50?

73
00:02:57,312 --> 00:02:59,612
Where am I?

74
00:02:59,614 --> 00:03:03,116
Relax, Mr. Smith.
You're in an alien hospital.

75
00:03:03,118 --> 00:03:04,951
I mean, to you,
it's an alien hospital.

76
00:03:04,953 --> 00:03:06,386
To me,
you're just in a hospital.

77
00:03:06,388 --> 00:03:08,121
There's another matter
we need to discuss with you.

78
00:03:08,123 --> 00:03:09,055
Okay.

79
00:03:09,057 --> 00:03:10,623
An hour ago, shrimply pibbles,

80
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:13,393
the galaxy's most influential
civil rights leader,

81
00:03:13,395 --> 00:03:15,962
was brought to this hospital's
emergency room,

82
00:03:15,964 --> 00:03:18,464
where he is currently fighting
for his life.

83
00:03:18,466 --> 00:03:19,465
My God.

84
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:22,435
Mr. Smith,
shrimply pibbles' life

85
00:03:22,437 --> 00:03:27,173
can be saved if we replace
his heart with your human penis.

86
00:03:27,175 --> 00:03:28,741
I see. Wait, what?

87
00:03:28,743 --> 00:03:30,743
It's perfect.

88
00:03:30,745 --> 00:03:32,178
The configuration of veins,

89
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,447
the ratio of thickness
to elasticity,

90
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:37,450
the delicate asymmetry
of what you call your balls,

91
00:03:37,452 --> 00:03:39,652
and with relatively
few adjustments,

92
00:03:39,654 --> 00:03:42,855
your genitals can be molded
into a functioning heart

93
00:03:42,857 --> 00:03:45,325
for the most important man
in the universe.

94
00:03:45,327 --> 00:03:47,327
- Yeah, but... I mean...
- Oh, forget it!

95
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:49,495
I told you this was
a waste of time!

96
00:03:49,497 --> 00:03:50,663
Have respect, yarp.

97
00:03:50,665 --> 00:03:52,665
The earth man's world
is tiny and undeveloped.

98
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:55,101
He knows nothing
of the genocides of clorgon

99
00:03:55,103 --> 00:03:59,772
or the tragic events
of 65.3432.23/14.

100
00:03:59,774 --> 00:04:03,876
And even if he did,
he wouldn't comprehend them.

101
00:04:03,878 --> 00:04:06,112
I've dwelt among the humans.

102
00:04:06,114 --> 00:04:10,183
Their entire culture
is built around their penises.

103
00:04:10,185 --> 00:04:12,452
It's funny to say
they are small.

104
00:04:12,454 --> 00:04:14,821
It's funny to say they are big.

105
00:04:14,823 --> 00:04:16,356
I've been at parties

106
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:20,326
where humans have held
bottles, pencils, thermoses

107
00:04:20,328 --> 00:04:23,396
in front of themselves
and called out,

108
00:04:23,398 --> 00:04:26,866
"hey, look at me.
I'm Mr. so-and-so-dick.

109
00:04:26,868 --> 00:04:29,469
I've got such-and-such
for a penis."

110
00:04:29,471 --> 00:04:32,205
I never saw it
fail to get a laugh.

111
00:04:32,207 --> 00:04:33,873
All right! That's enough!

112
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:36,042
You guys are talking
about my species.

113
00:04:36,044 --> 00:04:38,411
We understand genocide.
We do it sometimes.

114
00:04:38,413 --> 00:04:40,146
<i>Then you would give your penis</i>

115
00:04:40,148 --> 00:04:42,849
so that shrimply pibbles might live?
Stop asking!

116
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:43,850
Yes, I will!

117
00:04:43,852 --> 00:04:45,151
That's right, assholes.

118
00:04:45,153 --> 00:04:46,919
Take my penis. Take it all!

119
00:04:46,921 --> 00:04:48,321
And tell shrimply pibbles

120
00:04:48,323 --> 00:04:50,390
that when the galaxy
came calling,

121
00:04:50,392 --> 00:04:53,126
Jerry Smith from earth
didn't flinch!

122
00:04:55,864 --> 00:04:57,096
Hey, w-what's wrong, Morty?

123
00:04:57,098 --> 00:04:59,265
Oh, you're worried
about your dad, huh?

124
00:04:59,267 --> 00:05:00,733
Huh? Oh, no, no, no.

125
00:05:00,735 --> 00:05:02,368
I'm just... I'm just looking

126
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,737
at that lady over there
getting coffee.

127
00:05:04,739 --> 00:05:05,905
What's up with her face?

128
00:05:05,907 --> 00:05:07,740
Is she human,
or is she like worf?

129
00:05:07,742 --> 00:05:09,509
You know,
worf from "Star Trek,"

130
00:05:09,511 --> 00:05:12,078
how he has all that shit
all over his face,

131
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,447
but he's just a human
in a costume, you know?

132
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:17,383
Morty, uh, let's see what
else is on, huh? Okay.

133
00:05:17,385 --> 00:05:19,685
<i>And now we're back to
"how did I get here?"</i>

134
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:22,121
<i>The only show
that makes you ask yourself,</i>

135
00:05:22,123 --> 00:05:24,090
<i>"how did I get here?"</i>

136
00:05:24,092 --> 00:05:25,224
<i></i>

137
00:05:25,226 --> 00:05:27,126
<i>Here's our first person.</i>

138
00:05:27,128 --> 00:05:29,262
<i>Oh. Oh, my God.</i>

139
00:05:29,264 --> 00:05:30,797
<i>How did I get here?</i>

140
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:32,398
<i>Hello?!</i>

141
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,934
<i>How did I get here?!
Somebody, help me, please!</i>

142
00:05:34,936 --> 00:05:37,470
All right!

143
00:05:37,472 --> 00:05:40,206
Holy crap! Look, it's that lady
with the shit on her face

144
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,708
like worf from "Star Trek"
that was getting coffee!

145
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,043
How did she get there?!

146
00:05:44,045 --> 00:05:45,611
Oh, my God, Morty,
how did she get there?

147
00:05:45,613 --> 00:05:47,747
<i>How did she get there?
</i>

148
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:50,550
Is that something
we should be concerned about?

149
00:05:50,552 --> 00:05:53,052
Just stay away
from the coffee machine.

150
00:05:53,054 --> 00:05:55,588
Calling all Jan Michael Vincents.

151
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,824
Calling all
jan Michael Vincents.

152
00:05:57,826 --> 00:05:59,292
In a world

153
00:05:59,294 --> 00:06:00,626
where there's eight
jan Michael Vincents...

154
00:06:00,628 --> 00:06:02,895
We need one
jan Michael Vincent

155
00:06:02,897 --> 00:06:04,230
to quadrant "c."

156
00:06:04,232 --> 00:06:06,399
We need two jan Michael Vincents
to quadrant "e."

157
00:06:06,401 --> 00:06:07,967
<i>and 16 quadrants,</i>

158
00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:11,237
<i>there's only enough time
for a jan Michael Vincent</i>

159
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:12,805
<i>to make it to a quadrant.</i>

160
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:15,508
<i>He can't be at two quadrants
at once.</i>

161
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,977
Hey, Rick, who...
who is jan Michael Vincent?

162
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:19,078
Oh, man.

163
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,480
I'm trying to remember, Morty.

164
00:06:20,482 --> 00:06:22,982
<i>Jan Michael Vincents
are used up.</i>

165
00:06:22,984 --> 00:06:26,419
I need a goddamn
jan Michael Vincent.

166
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:29,322
Is it important that we know
who jan Michael Vincent was

167
00:06:29,324 --> 00:06:30,823
- in order to get this?
- Nope.

168
00:06:30,825 --> 00:06:33,993
I-I refuse to send
the legislation that allows

169
00:06:33,995 --> 00:06:36,496
more than eight
jan Michael Vincents

170
00:06:36,498 --> 00:06:37,330
to a precinct.

171
00:06:37,332 --> 00:06:39,499
<i>This jan-uary,</i>

172
00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:42,835
<i>it's time to Michael down
your Vincents.</i>

173
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:46,772
<i>"Jan quadrant Vincent 16."</i>

174
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:47,773
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

175
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:49,141
That's jan Michaels.

176
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:51,110
Excuse me, nurse,
can you take my temperature

177
00:06:51,112 --> 00:06:52,478
because I think I have

178
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,014
jan quadrant Vincent fever
over here.

179
00:06:55,016 --> 00:06:57,183
All right, Morty!
You've done it.

180
00:06:57,185 --> 00:07:00,353
So, we'll be detaching
your sexual organ at the base

181
00:07:00,355 --> 00:07:02,388
by making incisions
here, here, and here.

182
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,523
Got it.

183
00:07:03,525 --> 00:07:05,525
Leaving a partial length
of severed urethra

184
00:07:05,527 --> 00:07:07,393
- to be threaded through...
-

185
00:07:07,395 --> 00:07:10,229
Oh, you know what, I got to...
I got to laugh at myself here.

186
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:12,031
I'm having a little laugh
at myself

187
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:13,900
because I just realized
I haven't run

188
00:07:13,902 --> 00:07:15,468
this whole decision
past my wife.

189
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:18,070
Oh. Do you think
she'll be okay with this?

190
00:07:18,072 --> 00:07:19,305
Oh, absolutely.

191
00:07:19,307 --> 00:07:21,340
Beth's automatically
on board always

192
00:07:21,342 --> 00:07:23,175
with every decision I make.

193
00:07:23,177 --> 00:07:24,544
<i>Hey, I'm stealy.</i>

194
00:07:24,546 --> 00:07:27,713
Follow me on my adventure
through this office.

195
00:07:27,715 --> 00:07:29,749
?

196
00:07:29,751 --> 00:07:31,150
All right, here we go.

197
00:07:31,152 --> 00:07:33,052
We're gonna just steal
a couple of things.

198
00:07:33,054 --> 00:07:34,420
Excuse me. Can I help you?

199
00:07:34,422 --> 00:07:36,389
Starting with common
office objects.

200
00:07:36,391 --> 00:07:38,157
Hey, hey, hey! That's my stuff!

201
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,559
Such as staplers and pins

202
00:07:39,561 --> 00:07:41,727
and all sorts of things like...
such as that.

203
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:43,729
That's it.
I'm calling security.

204
00:07:43,731 --> 00:07:45,598
No!

205
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:49,735
?

206
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:52,605
All right, okay,
now we're in the quiet safe room

207
00:07:52,607 --> 00:07:55,274
where none of the people
whose stuff I stole

208
00:07:55,276 --> 00:07:56,576
can get to us.

209
00:07:56,578 --> 00:07:58,744
Now, let's look
at all the stuff we got.

210
00:07:58,746 --> 00:08:01,280
We got a bag of bobbish.

211
00:08:01,282 --> 00:08:03,783
That's eight brapples.

212
00:08:03,785 --> 00:08:05,751
We got a plumbus.

213
00:08:05,753 --> 00:08:08,120
That's 61/2 brapples.

214
00:08:08,122 --> 00:08:11,591
We got, uh, a...
crushed red party cups.

215
00:08:11,593 --> 00:08:13,426
151/2 brapples.

216
00:08:15,063 --> 00:08:16,696
Welcome back to "funny songs."

217
00:08:16,698 --> 00:08:19,098
It's all improvised.
It's very funny.

218
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,400
I need a volunteer
from the audience.

219
00:08:21,402 --> 00:08:23,603
Um, longtime fan
of the show. Uh...

220
00:08:23,605 --> 00:08:26,105
what do you do?
What's your profession?

221
00:08:26,107 --> 00:08:28,240
I am a tax attorney.

222
00:08:28,242 --> 00:08:30,876
Okay, here we go.
Hit... hit the music.

223
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:32,111
?

224
00:08:32,113 --> 00:08:34,313
? I'm a tax attorney

225
00:08:34,315 --> 00:08:36,148
? oh, geez, oh

226
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,150
? forget about everybody else

227
00:08:38,152 --> 00:08:40,052
? forget about Jesus Christ

228
00:08:40,054 --> 00:08:41,554
? forget about muhammad

229
00:08:41,556 --> 00:08:45,257
? forget about, uh...
All those religions ?

230
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:48,127
? Ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba-bop

231
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:49,395
the end.

232
00:08:49,397 --> 00:08:51,297
Oh, my God.
Oh, that was so, so funny.

233
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:52,632
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

234
00:08:52,634 --> 00:08:54,600
Hey, um, security guards,
take him out.

235
00:08:54,602 --> 00:08:56,168
- Get him out of here.
- What?

236
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,637
Get the orthodontist
out of here.

237
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:59,105
No! Why?

238
00:08:59,107 --> 00:09:02,942
Take him out of the audience.
Kill him. Sic him.

239
00:09:02,944 --> 00:09:03,943
Demons...

240
00:09:03,945 --> 00:09:05,144
<i>Suck his life out.</i>

241
00:09:05,146 --> 00:09:06,445
<i>I don't give a shit.</i>

242
00:09:06,447 --> 00:09:07,947
- Smith family?
- Yes?

243
00:09:07,949 --> 00:09:11,150
I wanted to let you all know
that Jerry is doing just fine.

244
00:09:11,152 --> 00:09:12,985
- Yay! Called it!
- Yes! Whoo-hoo!

245
00:09:12,987 --> 00:09:15,921
That's good news! But, uh,
Mrs. Smith, could you come with me?

246
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,258
Hi, honey,
so, here's the thing...

247
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,360
these guys...
they want to completely

248
00:09:21,362 --> 00:09:24,130
remove my penis and use it
as an alien's heart.

249
00:09:24,132 --> 00:09:26,165
And we just need you
to sign off on it.

250
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:27,667
- What?!
- Uh-oh.

251
00:09:27,669 --> 00:09:30,870
Maybe we got a problem here
after all, guys. Yikes.

252
00:09:30,872 --> 00:09:33,706
His penis will be replaced
with a sophisticated prosthetic.

253
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:36,342
Now, there's a wide range
of options to choose from.

254
00:09:36,344 --> 00:09:37,843
They're all in this catalogue.

255
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:40,312
I don't care about prosthetics.
This is insane.

256
00:09:40,314 --> 00:09:42,281
What do you people
think you're doing?

257
00:09:42,283 --> 00:09:44,316
I understand your feelings,
Mrs. Smith.

258
00:09:44,318 --> 00:09:45,618
Oh, I don't think you do.

259
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,953
I bring my husband in
for emergency treatment.

260
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:49,488
He's gone an hour.

261
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,624
And now you want his penis,
and you hand me some... Catalog.

262
00:09:51,626 --> 00:09:53,893
It's... it's...
it's... it's... I mean...

263
00:09:53,895 --> 00:09:55,027
Sheesh.

264
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:56,862
Well, there you go. Sorry.

265
00:09:56,864 --> 00:10:00,900
I know it's hard to understand,
but on earth, love comes first.

266
00:10:00,902 --> 00:10:03,469
There are those that believe,
Mr. Smith,

267
00:10:03,471 --> 00:10:06,338
that shrimply pibbles represents
love between all life.

268
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,873
His fate will determine

269
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:11,544
the fate of hundreds of billions
of sentient life-forms.

270
00:10:11,546 --> 00:10:14,313
Whoa! Whoa.
So, billions of life-forms?

271
00:10:14,315 --> 00:10:15,881
Hundreds of billions.

272
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:18,818
I mean, Jerry,
y-you didn't explain

273
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,687
the full gravity
of the situation.

274
00:10:21,689 --> 00:10:24,223
Uh, well, Beth,
I don't think your decision

275
00:10:24,225 --> 00:10:25,758
should be based on politics.

276
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,993
Who could argue
with a wife's decision

277
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:29,395
to keep her lover intact?

278
00:10:29,397 --> 00:10:32,398
Well, I don't think that's
fair at all, Jerry. At all.

279
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,934
In fact, the whole paradigm
has sexist overtones.

280
00:10:34,936 --> 00:10:37,436
Beth, can we talk
about this privately.

281
00:10:37,438 --> 00:10:40,005
You know, I think
the bottom line is, Jerry,

282
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:43,409
if you want to keep your penis,
you should say, out loud,

283
00:10:43,411 --> 00:10:45,077
"I prefer to keep my penis."

284
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:47,747
But, Beth, what kind of man
would say something like that

285
00:10:47,749 --> 00:10:49,548
if the universe needed
his penis?!

286
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,017
Well, Jerry,
what kind of wife would I be

287
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,854
if I did anything
to stand in your way?

288
00:10:58,191 --> 00:10:59,925
<i>Hey, listen,</i>

289
00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:01,627
is your mouth tiny and small?

290
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:04,196
- Then why don't you come to lil' bits...
- Lil' bits!

291
00:11:04,198 --> 00:11:05,531
where the food is tiny.

292
00:11:05,533 --> 00:11:07,399
It looks like regular food,
but really tiny.

293
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:09,268
You can put it in your mouth
and eat it.

294
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,603
Nothing gets stuck in your lips.

295
00:11:10,605 --> 00:11:13,606
It's just tiny and tiny
and fits right...

296
00:11:13,608 --> 00:11:15,775
<i>- fits right in.
- Lil' bits!</i>

297
00:11:15,777 --> 00:11:18,978
We got tiny lasagna,
tiny Pizza, tiny pie.

298
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,981
Mmm! Little, tiny fried eggs.

299
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,583
Oh, shit. We got tiny people.

300
00:11:24,585 --> 00:11:25,451
<i>Lil' bits!</i>

301
00:11:25,453 --> 00:11:27,119
You hungry? Come on down.

302
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:28,554
<i>Lil' bits.</i>

303
00:11:28,556 --> 00:11:31,323
Eat some  shit,
you  stupid bitch.

304
00:11:31,325 --> 00:11:32,892
Just kidding.

305
00:11:32,894 --> 00:11:35,828
You've got some time to kill
before the procedure,

306
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,463
so I assume you'd like to, uh,

307
00:11:37,465 --> 00:11:39,265
use your penis one last time.

308
00:11:39,267 --> 00:11:40,466
Here's my computer.

309
00:11:40,468 --> 00:11:42,635
It's got the alien Internet
on it.

310
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,304
Here's some porn.

311
00:11:45,306 --> 00:11:46,639
And there's an alien towel.

312
00:11:46,641 --> 00:11:48,474
I actually got that
on another planet.

313
00:11:48,476 --> 00:11:50,075
So it is an alien towel to me.

314
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:51,977
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

315
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:03,322
What is this?

316
00:12:03,324 --> 00:12:04,190
Hmm.

317
00:12:04,192 --> 00:12:06,325
Hey, wait a minute.

318
00:12:06,327 --> 00:12:07,459
Oh, uh, Mr. Smith?

319
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:09,161
Uh, yeah, just masturbating!

320
00:12:09,163 --> 00:12:10,796
I forgot to mention,

321
00:12:10,798 --> 00:12:13,365
there are extensive medical
records open on my desktop,

322
00:12:13,367 --> 00:12:15,701
and I trust you
to confine your activities

323
00:12:15,703 --> 00:12:18,437
- to the purely pornographic.
- Absolutely!

324
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:19,805
Good luck.

325
00:12:21,976 --> 00:12:23,676
My God!

326
00:12:23,678 --> 00:12:26,612
Mr. pibbles,
you just wrote my penis

327
00:12:26,614 --> 00:12:29,949
a one-way ticket
to staying on my body town.

328
00:12:29,951 --> 00:12:33,719
It's the opposite
news with Michael Thompson.

329
00:12:33,721 --> 00:12:36,522
<i>Hey, everybody.
It's me, Michael Thompson.</i>

330
00:12:36,524 --> 00:12:38,724
<i>Today the pope
didn't get killed.</i>

331
00:12:38,726 --> 00:12:42,161
<i>He's perfectly fine.
And he's on vacation in Aruba.</i>

332
00:12:42,163 --> 00:12:44,530
<i>In other opposite news,
information...</i>

333
00:12:44,532 --> 00:12:46,332
Hey, Rick,
what's the deal with this guy?

334
00:12:46,334 --> 00:12:48,534
W-why is his body,
like, sloping off

335
00:12:48,536 --> 00:12:52,071
to the right side of the screen like that? I
don't know, Morty. See what else is on, huh?

336
00:12:52,073 --> 00:12:53,839
<i>Hey, welcome
to "cooking things."</i>

337
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:55,174
<i>I'm pichael Thompson.</i>

338
00:12:55,176 --> 00:12:56,475
Hey, wait a minute, Rick.

339
00:12:56,477 --> 00:12:58,043
This guy's body
is, like, sloping down

340
00:12:58,045 --> 00:12:59,478
and leaning off to screen left.

341
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,213
Oh, my God,
and his name's pichael.

342
00:13:01,215 --> 00:13:02,915
<i>I'm cooking
a little bit of this.</i>

343
00:13:02,917 --> 00:13:05,150
<i>I'm gonna cook
a little bit of that.</i>

344
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:07,152
<i>Oh, oh, hey!
Stop tugging, Michael!</i>

345
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:08,420
Oh, my God! Siamese twins!

346
00:13:08,422 --> 00:13:10,022
They're...
they're siamese twins!

347
00:13:10,024 --> 00:13:12,424
<i>You quit tugging.
I-I'm in the middle of my news.</i>

348
00:13:12,426 --> 00:13:14,393
<i>Oh, oh, it's always about you,
isn't it?</i>

349
00:13:14,395 --> 00:13:16,562
<i>Can you believe this guy,
ladies and gentlemen?</i>

350
00:13:16,564 --> 00:13:18,831
<i>He's got his own news show.
He's got a normal name.</i>

351
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,733
- Hey, flip back to the news.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

352
00:13:20,735 --> 00:13:23,202
<i>You could tell our parents
started with naming with him.</i>

353
00:13:23,204 --> 00:13:24,236
<i>It's like, "oh, Michael."</i>

354
00:13:24,238 --> 00:13:25,671
<i>They had that one planned</i>

355
00:13:25,673 --> 00:13:27,039
<i>before they even got pregnant,
I bet.</i>

356
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,274
I don't want to be that girl,

357
00:13:28,276 --> 00:13:29,742
but maybe there would be
less conflict

358
00:13:29,744 --> 00:13:32,011
if they didn't shoot their shows
at the same time.

359
00:13:32,013 --> 00:13:33,345
Oh, summer, you have no idea

360
00:13:33,347 --> 00:13:34,780
how much money
that must save production.

361
00:13:34,782 --> 00:13:36,582
<i>And then they found out
I was attached,</i>

362
00:13:36,584 --> 00:13:38,584
<i>along for the ride,
and they said, "ah, shit."</i>

363
00:13:38,586 --> 00:13:40,419
<i>Well, just  it,
call him pichael."</i>

364
00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:42,855
<i> You, pichael.
You're a  piece of shit.</i>

365
00:13:42,857 --> 00:13:44,256
?

366
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,959
Good afternoon.

367
00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:48,527
I know all of you are wondering

368
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:51,096
about the condition
of our dear, beloved pibbles.

369
00:13:51,098 --> 00:13:54,733
Which would you prefer between
the xp-20 and the xp-20 xs?

370
00:13:54,735 --> 00:13:57,469
I prefer my own penis,
and so should you!

371
00:13:57,471 --> 00:13:59,638
The brave earth man
whose sacrifice

372
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,741
is going to allow
shrimply pibbles to live...

373
00:14:02,743 --> 00:14:03,809
Mr. Jerry Smith.

374
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:06,612
Hello, everyone!

375
00:14:06,614 --> 00:14:09,148
Let's hear it again
for shrimply pibbles, huh?

376
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,749
He's a good guy, isn't he?

377
00:14:10,751 --> 00:14:13,819
I've only just been learning
about his accomplishments,

378
00:14:13,821 --> 00:14:16,288
from his march
on flirk blirk square

379
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:19,058
to his ongoing battle
with heroin dependency.

380
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,059
He's the best.

381
00:14:22,763 --> 00:14:25,397
Um, yeah.

382
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:28,267
Well, I-it occurs to me
that his heroin addiction

383
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:30,736
may not have been
a matter of public record.

384
00:14:30,738 --> 00:14:34,273
You realize heroin makes up
10% of the atmosphere

385
00:14:34,275 --> 00:14:36,642
on shrimply pibbles'
home planet.

386
00:14:36,644 --> 00:14:39,011
His planet was destroyed
by clorgon death squads.

387
00:14:39,013 --> 00:14:41,747
He can't live outside of it
without breathing heroin.

388
00:14:41,749 --> 00:14:44,416
Right. I know that.
I just think...

389
00:14:44,418 --> 00:14:48,153
This guy's trying to get out of
giving away his penis!

390
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:54,693
Today on "how they do it"...

391
00:14:54,695 --> 00:14:56,161
<i>Plumbuses.</i>

392
00:14:56,163 --> 00:14:58,697
Everyone has a plumbus
in their home.

393
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,334
First, they take the dinglebop,

394
00:15:02,336 --> 00:15:05,938
and they smooth it out
with a bunch of schleem.

395
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:10,943
The schleem is then repurposed
for later batches.

396
00:15:10,945 --> 00:15:12,177
They take the dinglebop,

397
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:13,979
and they push it
through the grumbo,

398
00:15:13,981 --> 00:15:16,215
where the fleeb
is rubbed against it.

399
00:15:16,217 --> 00:15:18,350
It's important that the fleeb
is rubbed

400
00:15:18,352 --> 00:15:21,520
because the fleeb
has all of the fleeb juice.

401
00:15:21,522 --> 00:15:23,989
Then a schlami shows up,

402
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:26,859
and he rubs it and spits on it.

403
00:15:26,861 --> 00:15:28,193
They cut the fleeb.

404
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:30,696
There's several hizards
in the way.

405
00:15:30,698 --> 00:15:33,832
The blamfs rub
against the chumbles.

406
00:15:33,834 --> 00:15:37,536
And the ploobis and grumbo
are shaved away.

407
00:15:37,538 --> 00:15:41,073
That leaves you
with a regular, old plumbus.

408
00:15:41,075 --> 00:15:44,376
I always wondered how,
uh, plumbuses got made.

409
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:48,080
<i>Hey, welcome back
to "personal space."</i>

410
00:15:48,082 --> 00:15:49,815
<i>I'm your host Phillip Jacobs,</i>

411
00:15:49,817 --> 00:15:53,152

I care about my personal space.</i>

412
00:15:53,154 --> 00:15:56,255
<i>Whoa, whoa. Hey.
Who's around me right now?</i>

413
00:15:56,257 --> 00:15:58,090
<i>Who's around me?</i>

414
00:15:58,092 --> 00:16:01,493
<i>Now, why don't we step up here
and everybody get stepped up</i>

415
00:16:01,495 --> 00:16:04,563
<i>and let's get
some stepped-up personal space</i>

416
00:16:04,565 --> 00:16:06,031
<i>up in this place.</i>

417
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:07,099
<i>Here we go.</i>

418
00:16:07,101 --> 00:16:09,401
<i>We get a one, personal space.</i>

419
00:16:09,403 --> 00:16:11,003
<i>Two, personal space.</i>

420
00:16:11,005 --> 00:16:13,272
<i>Three,
stay out of my personal space.</i>

421
00:16:13,274 --> 00:16:16,075
<i>Four, keep away
from my personal space.</i>

422
00:16:16,077 --> 00:16:17,109
<i>Five...</i>

423
00:16:17,111 --> 00:16:19,078
Get out of that personal space.

424
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,379
<i>Six...</i>

425
00:16:20,381 --> 00:16:22,014
<i>Stay away

<i>Seven...</i>

427

<i>Keep away
from that personal space.</i>

428
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:27,419
<i>Eight, personal space.</i>

429
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:29,922
<i>Nine, personal space.</i>

430
00:16:29,924 --> 00:16:33,025
<i>You know, I take personal space
pretty seriously,</i>

431
00:16:33,027 --> 00:16:36,228
<i>up to the point that I don't
even care about this...</i>

432
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,264
<i>I'm not even interested
in having this skin</i>

433
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:40,766

434
00:16:40,768 --> 00:16:41,767

excuse me. Come on.

451
00:17:28,983 --> 00:17:31,984
Please, everyone, I have news
about shrimply pibbles.

452
00:17:31,986 --> 00:17:33,152
Word of Jerry Smith

453
00:17:33,154 --> 00:17:36,255
trying to weasel out
of his penis donation

454
00:17:36,257 --> 00:17:37,990
has spread across the galaxy.

455
00:17:37,992 --> 00:17:40,492
Beings everywhere
have come together

456
00:17:40,494 --> 00:17:43,929
to offer what little they have
to help save shrimply's life.

457
00:17:43,931 --> 00:17:47,966
Enough to pay for a brand-new,
state-of-the-art synthetic heart

458
00:17:47,968 --> 00:17:51,670
that will be even better
than Mr. Smith's pathetic penis.

459
00:17:51,672 --> 00:17:54,206
Wait! That was an option
the whole time?!

460
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,607
You guys suck!

461
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:58,677
<i>Yeah. We suck.
Are you still here?</i>

462
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:00,479
Okay, Jerry. Let's head home.

463
00:18:00,481 --> 00:18:02,514
I can't leave now.
Everyone hates me.

464
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:05,150
Unfortunately,
there's no surgical procedure

465
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:07,352
that can fix that.

466
00:18:07,354 --> 00:18:09,688
Or is there?

467
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:12,724
- Scalpel.
- Scalpel.

00:18:17,231 --> 00:18:18,897
Okay. We're ready.

472
00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:20,165
Not so fast!

473
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:22,367
Mr. Smith? What are you doing?
Are you insane?!

474

I'm a good person,

475
00:18:23,671 --> 00:18:26,538

that you cut off my penis

476
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,041
and put it in that man's chest.

477
00:18:29,043 --> 00:18:30,008
That's not how it works!

478
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:32,110
Well, you're gonna

Well, summer,
maybe people that create things

aren't concerned

with your delicate
sensibilities, you know?

495
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,420
Maybe the species
that communicate with each other

496
00:19:15,422 --> 00:19:16,955
through the filter
of your comfort

497
00:19:16,957 --> 00:19:19,091
are less evolved than
the ones that just communicate!

498
00:19:19,093 --> 00:19:21,093
Maybe your problems
are your own to deal with,

499
00:19:21,095 --> 00:19:23,295
and maybe the public giving
a shit about your feelings

Where did he get a gun?
Who gave him a gun?

519
00:19:56,897 --> 00:19:59,164
That's not a gun.
That's the xp-20 xs.

520
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,566
Ah!

521
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:07,072
Oh, my God.

522
00:20:07,074 --> 00:20:08,640
I'm a good person.

523
00:20:15,316 --> 00:20:16,648
No!

524
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,851
Nooooo!

525
00:20:19,853 --> 00:20:22,621
<i></i>

526
00:20:25,793 --> 00:20:27,159
Hey, how's it going?

527
00:20:27,161 --> 00:20:29,027
<i>This is
my butthole ice cream parlor.</i>

528
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:31,763
<i>I got all kinds of ice cream...
peanut butter and jelly...</i>

529
00:20:31,765 --> 00:20:33,098
<i> - ...Vanilla...</i>

530
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,666
<i> - ...Chocolate...</i>

531
00:20:34,668 --> 00:20:36,368
<i> - ...And every flavor</i>

532
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:37,836
<i>served out of a butthole...</i>

533
00:20:37,838 --> 00:20:39,604
-
- ...Just like you're back home.

534
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:40,672
- Dad!
- Dad!

535
00:20:40,674 --> 00:20:42,841
What happened? Where am I?

536
00:20:42,843 --> 00:20:44,476
Was it all a dream?

537
00:20:44,478 --> 00:20:46,144
No, you were shot
like 50 times.

538
00:20:46,146 --> 00:20:49,047
57. Thankfully,
you're in a super-sophisticated

539
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:50,282
alien hospital,

540
00:20:50,284 --> 00:20:52,351
so it was basically like
getting a splinter removed.

541
00:20:52,353 --> 00:20:54,720
All... all I wanted
was for everyone to like me.

542
00:20:54,722 --> 00:20:56,321
Jerry, remember that time
you left a comment

543
00:20:56,323 --> 00:20:58,323
underneath that YouTube video
and someone replied

544
00:20:58,325 --> 00:21:00,325
and called you a dumb-ass,
so you replied and told them,

545
00:21:00,327 --> 00:21:02,561
"it takes one to know one,"
and you stayed up all night

546
00:21:02,563 --> 00:21:04,062
hitting "refresh"
on your browser

547
00:21:04,064 --> 00:21:06,198
waiting for them to reply
and then you fell asleep crying?

548
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,866
I remember it differently.

549
00:21:07,868 --> 00:21:10,202
This is like that.
You can't make people like you.

550
00:21:10,204 --> 00:21:12,704
You just have to wait
for hating you to bore them.

551
00:21:12,706 --> 00:21:14,172
You know, you're right.

552
00:21:14,174 --> 00:21:15,207
I shouldn't be motivated

553
00:21:15,209 --> 00:21:17,175
by other people's
opinions of me.

554
00:21:17,177 --> 00:21:18,577
All right, guys, let's go home.

555
00:21:18,579 --> 00:21:20,011
If it's all the same
to you, Rick,

556
00:21:20,013 --> 00:21:21,546
I'd like to go to the zoo...

557
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:22,881
- With my family.
- What?!

558
00:21:22,883 --> 00:21:25,050
What are you talking about?!
Why would we do that?!

559
00:21:25,052 --> 00:21:27,552
It's a stupid idea! What's the matter with
you!? Don't be a piece of shit, Jerry!

560
00:21:27,554 --> 00:21:30,555
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We'll go home.
What the hell is he talking about?!

561
00:21:30,557 --> 00:21:33,759
?

562
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:11,463
<i>- Aah!
- I'm the eyehole man!</i>

563
00:22:11,465 --> 00:22:13,965
<i>What is going on? Aah! Give me my eyeholes!
Give me my eyeholes!</i>

564
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:17,035
<i>Give me my eyeholes! I'm eyehole man!
That part of the cupboard is mine, Jerry!</i>

565
00:22:17,037 --> 00:22:18,370
Why do you even have those?!

566
00:22:18,372 --> 00:22:20,071
<i>- Give me my eyeholes!
- Help me, please!</i>

567
00:22:20,073 --> 00:22:22,174
<i>Get up on out of here
with my eyeholes!</i>
