1
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,979
Rick, we did it! We... we got it!

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,519
Hurry up, Morty. Get in!

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,169
- Chachi!
- [BLEEP] Chachi, Morty.

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,259
- Did you get it?
- He helped me escape prison.

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,320
Did you get the ultimate cube?

6
00:00:12,325 --> 00:00:14,129
Oh, it's purple.

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,299
Y-you said it was purple.

8
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,439
I said mine was.

9
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,160
I didn't know they all were.

10
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,579
And now we do, thanks to Chichi.

11
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,834
Chachi.

12
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,879
So, uh, w-w-when do I get it?

13
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,899
Get what, a hug?

14
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,757
Let's find a planet with
a garden hose first.

15
00:00:28,758 --> 00:00:30,339
- A dragon.
- A dragon.

16
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,289
You asked me to cut class
and fight robots with you.

17
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,299
I said, "no."

18
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,959
You said, "millions of
lives depend on it."

19
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,620
I said, "I'll do it for a dragon."

20
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,200
You said, "whatever."

21
00:00:38,209 --> 00:00:39,679
I want my dragon.

22
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,139
You know who's into dragons, Morty?

23
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,099
Nerds that refuse to
admit they're Christian.

24
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,159
- I want my dragon.
- Let me give you rocket shoes.

25
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,579
Let me give you wolverine claws.

26
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,239
Let me give you a [BLEEP] rocket hat.

27
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,919
Just be sure to use it
with the rocket shoes,

28
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,929
or it'll rip your head off.

29
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,115
I want my dragon! I want my dragon!

30
00:00:53,116 --> 00:00:54,309
I want my dragon!

31
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:55,840
- Oh.
- Ha! Ha!

32
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,359
Oh, crap.

33
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,454
Crap.

34
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:03,450
Dad, are you okay?

35
00:01:03,454 --> 00:01:05,377
Your ship crashed in Malta.

36
00:01:05,378 --> 00:01:06,795
I'm okay.

37
00:01:06,796 --> 00:01:08,410
Oh, thank God.

38
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,384
Dad, did you promise Morty a dragon?

39
00:01:11,385 --> 00:01:13,009
Fuuuuuuu...

41
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:45,929
Ugh!

42
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,359
Bleed here and here.

43
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,379
I'm not co-bleeding.

44
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,199
Under authority of our treaty

45
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,299
'twixt the realms of dragon and man...

46
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,399
Oh, my God, it's my first gay wedding.

47
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,890
- Summer!
- ... I hereby bind

48
00:01:55,895 --> 00:01:57,999
this noble serpent and rider

49
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,640
at the soul.

50
00:01:59,641 --> 00:02:02,849
Here's your tome of
dragon spells and lore.

51
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,019
That'll have everything you need.

52
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,139
Enjoy your dragon.

53
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,260
Okay, dragon, here's the house rules.

54
00:02:07,267 --> 00:02:10,390
My name is Balthromaw,

55
00:02:10,391 --> 00:02:12,859
breaker of sky, slayer of mountain.

56
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,519
Rule one... you are now
scooper of your own poops,

57
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,499
or I will take you down like the
black-light poster you are.

58
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,299
I don't got any more rules. That's it.

59
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,609
I'm guessing you'd rather
not be tagged in this.

60
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,620
Okay, I'll bite.

61
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:26,873
What's with the talking cat?

62
00:02:26,874 --> 00:02:29,939
- It's a dragon, dip knob.
- I know that's a dragon.

63
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,795
I'm talking about the
talking cat in my bedroom.

64
00:02:32,796 --> 00:02:34,719
Jerry, why would I give
Morty a talking dragon

65
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,460
and you a talking cat at the same time?

66
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,799
Those concepts bump.

67
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,940
If you're talking to a cat,
it's an abnormal event

68
00:02:39,941 --> 00:02:42,140
unrelated to me like
when you went to Pluto

69
00:02:42,144 --> 00:02:43,769
or [BLEEP] my daughter.

70
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,354
Okay, there's really
no need to get savage.

71
00:02:47,622 --> 00:02:48,760
So?

72
00:02:48,764 --> 00:02:50,774
Eh, he says he has nothing
to do with your talking.

73
00:02:50,775 --> 00:02:53,442
- Told you.
- So then why are you talking?

74
00:02:53,443 --> 00:02:55,999
- Why should that matter?
- Why should it not matter?

75
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
How do I know I'm not hallucinating?

76
00:02:58,006 --> 00:02:59,825
Rick said this is an abnormal event.

77
00:02:59,826 --> 00:03:02,039
Do you always need Rick to
tell you what's going on?

78
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,160
Maybe it's time you
stopped asking questions

79
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,290
and started having fun.

80
00:03:06,296 --> 00:03:08,329
Oh.

81
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,079
Wow, okay.

82
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,119
So, what do you want?

83
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,659
I want you to take us to the airport

84
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,180
and get us two first-class
tickets to Florida.

85
00:03:16,183 --> 00:03:19,319
Why, I... I can do that.

86
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,839
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

87
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,099
Oh, this is so cool!

88
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,049
I await your next command.

89
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,064
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

90
00:03:34,065 --> 00:03:35,610
Nobody is commanding anybody.

91
00:03:35,613 --> 00:03:39,009
I love soaring through the
sky with you as equals.

92
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,469
W-what do you want to do?

93
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,559
I want to enter my lair
and sleep upon my hoard

94
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,949
until the age of man expires.

95
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,580
Okay.

96
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:49,219
Split the diff?

97
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,539
20-minute nap and soar through the sky?

98
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,549
Ugh.

99
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,560
As you command.

100
00:03:55,563 --> 00:03:57,129
Okay, see you soon.

101
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,589
T-this is fun.

102
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,799
Yeah, right.

103
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,199
What's this show called, "Ass"?

104
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,899
Yeah, it's like "Bones,"
but they solve ass crimes.

105
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,069
This ass is a clue.

106
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,369
Are these two gonna hook up?

107
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,439
No, and only the lame fans want that.

108
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,130
Don't tell me how to enjoy things.

109
00:04:12,136 --> 00:04:13,950
- Go to her ass.
- That's Brenner.

110
00:04:13,957 --> 00:04:15,730
Go to Brenner ass.

111
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,059
Honeymoon over already?

112
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,199
What's that supposed to mean?

113
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,959
Admit it, Morty. Dragons suck.

114
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,079
Why don't you admit you don't
anyone else to be happy

115
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,910
because you're a sad old fart?

116
00:04:25,911 --> 00:04:27,919
How do you saddle a fart?

117
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,959
Holy [BLEEP], look!

118
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,169
- I love you, Ass.
- I love you, Brenner.

119
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,309
- No.
- Shh.

120
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,730
- Ah!
- Whoa!

121
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,399
And that's the end of the

122
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,859
"Morty gets a dragon" episode.

123
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,340
- Are you gonna slay it?
- First off, I always slay it, Queen.

124
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:42,470
- Secondly, yes.
- Should I pause "Ass"?

125
00:04:42,472 --> 00:04:45,138
Nah, it's kind of boring
now that they're together.

126
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:51,879
Hey, [BLEEP] face!

127
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,599
Will you shut the [BLEEP]
up or at least roll over?

128
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,779
Oh, no, it burns.

129
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,237
Oh, my God. Oh,
the fire of... of it all.

130
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,379
Ah, if only I had prepared better

131
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,220
for this terrifying
battle by remembering

132
00:05:03,222 --> 00:05:05,784
the only thing dragons are known for.

133
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,042
Careful you don't get heartburn.

134
00:05:14,043 --> 00:05:16,045
I made that android with a lot of C4.

135
00:05:16,046 --> 00:05:17,899
Oh, I'm sorry. I imbued it

136
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,841
with a remote-controlled
explode-y potion.

137
00:05:20,842 --> 00:05:22,290
You have bested me.

138
00:05:22,295 --> 00:05:24,511
I am at your service.

139
00:05:24,512 --> 00:05:25,939
Good to be on the same parchment.

140
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,639
Now, I'm gonna tell my
grandson you ran off

141
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,800
with a low-flying 747
while you pack up your...

142
00:05:30,808 --> 00:05:33,019
Wait, is this... Why do
you have an original

143
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,999
ecto cooler juice box from 1989?

144
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,819
I hoard that which your kind covets.

145
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,695
- Give you 20 bucks for it.
- Nice try.

146
00:05:41,696 --> 00:05:43,405
What the hell else are
you hoarding down here?

147
00:05:43,406 --> 00:05:45,949
Cha-ching. "Small soldiers" spin pops?

148
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,610
- Don't open that.
- I'm not an idiot.

149
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:50,579
Hey, why do you have future's
self-titled album on vinyl?

150
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,038
Look closer.

151
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:54,049
Oh, [BLEEP], he signed it.

152
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,720
Closer.

153
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:57,929
He signed it in Molly and Percocet?

154
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,439
I could spend all night down here.

155
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,440
Do you indulge in volcanic fumes?

156
00:06:03,675 --> 00:06:05,149
Is it gonna [BLEEP] up my brain?

157
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,660
- No.
- I'll do it anyway.

158
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,599
Hoo, those were not cheap tickets,

159
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,460
but, um, I'm down to clown.

160
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,199
Uh, w-w-w-why can you talk again, uh?

161
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,619
It's not important, Jerry.

162
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,959
Okay, but why Florida?

163
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,770
Because they don't ask questions.

164
00:06:21,777 --> 00:06:24,130
They play volleyball, they
party, and they have fun.

165
00:06:24,136 --> 00:06:25,669
Right, right.

166
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,170
You can do this, Jerry.

167
00:06:27,175 --> 00:06:30,319
I can do this. I can do this.

168
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,047
Ohh!

169
00:06:32,048 --> 00:06:33,200
Ugh!

170
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:35,332
Oh, yeah.

171
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,649
Hey, Jerry, after this game,

172
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,359
come to my yacht and bring your cat.

173
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,780
You got it, Jipe.

174
00:06:40,782 --> 00:06:42,699
I got to admit, you were right.

175
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,430
I've got to tell you something, Jerry.

176
00:06:44,431 --> 00:06:47,030
This is the happiest I've
ever been in my entire life.

177
00:06:47,035 --> 00:06:49,679
Oh, gross! Who shit in the sand?

178
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,199
Someone took a small shit in the sand

179
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,200
and buried it with,
like, two little kicks

180
00:06:54,204 --> 00:06:56,570
and just left it here like a land mine.

181
00:06:56,572 --> 00:06:58,814
Why and who?

182
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,919
It was him.

183
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,879
Help!

184
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,659
I'm being summoned by Morty.

185
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,639
Yeah. He's, uh, texting me.

186
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,889
Hmm. How are you responding?

187
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,439
Ugh, I tend not to,

188
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,019
or maybe I'll send, like,
a popular animated gif

189
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,079
that could be interpreted
in almost any way.

190
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,129
Brilliant.

191
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,940
I summon thee.

192
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:40,559
I summon thee, Balthromaw.

193
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,899
What the hell?

194
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,359
Taylor swift pumping
her hands in the air?

195
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,360
- What does it mean when...
- It means you're lame.

196
00:08:01,776 --> 00:08:03,440
What's the saying?

197
00:08:03,446 --> 00:08:07,132
"Orcs work to live.
Dwarves live to work."

198
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:08,389
So dumb.

199
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,679
If there's ever a saying about me,

200
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,349
I'll fly into the [BLEEP] sun.

201
00:08:14,857 --> 00:08:17,350
Oh, you're small for a dragon, Rick.

202
00:08:17,351 --> 00:08:20,139
Well, I sleep on an extra
big pile of awesome shit.

203
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,749
Then there will be sayings about you.

204
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,816
Your lessers will hunt you down,

205
00:08:24,817 --> 00:08:28,269
and you will be owned or slain.

206
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,531
That's why they call it
a dying breed, brother.

207
00:08:34,275 --> 00:08:35,749
Ugh! Ughh!

208
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,779
Oh, God.

209
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,499
- Ugh. My soul.
- Oh!

210
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,240
Oh, yeah. I'm...

211
00:08:40,249 --> 00:08:42,259
I'm... I'm a dragon.

212
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,739
- Oh!
- Ugh, I'm bonding.

213
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,587
I'm bonding too.

214
00:08:45,588 --> 00:08:47,505
- Oh!
- Yeah.

215
00:08:47,506 --> 00:08:48,882
What the [BLEEP]!

216
00:08:48,883 --> 00:08:51,189
- Morty, I can explain.
- Stop!

217
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,739
Why are you still doing it?

218
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,449
Why does it feel better now?

219
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,890
I hope it's not because you're
watching, but don't go anywhere.

220
00:08:56,891 --> 00:08:58,799
How did you find us?

221
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,728
We followed the smell
of sulfur and skankery.

222
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,981
- Oh!
- Oh, yeah.

223
00:09:04,982 --> 00:09:07,219
- Oh, man, ugh.
- [BLEEP] this.

224
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,599
You can take this stupid
fake soul-bond contract,

225
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,363
and you can... mm! Ah!

226
00:09:12,346 --> 00:09:13,779
No refunds.

227
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,199
Your dragon soul-bonded with my grandpa.

228
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,659
Oh, my! I am so sorry.

229
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,206
- That is a total violation.
- Yeah, no shit.

230
00:09:21,207 --> 00:09:23,300
I'll take care of this at once.

231
00:09:23,307 --> 00:09:24,769
You slut dragon!

232
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:25,770
- What the [BLEEP]!
- You slut.

233
00:09:25,771 --> 00:09:26,779
- Chill out, dude.
- Slut!

234
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,010
- Okay, that's...
- You slut!

235
00:09:28,012 --> 00:09:29,130
- Y-you don't have to...
- Slut!

236
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:30,360
Shame on you!

237
00:09:30,368 --> 00:09:32,049
- Shame, you slut! You slutty...
- Ow!

238
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,059
- ... slutty...
- Why the [BLEEP] does it feel

239
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,099
- like you're whipping me?
- ... slut!

240
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,099
Because your soul got tangled

241
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,469
- in a dirty...
- Ah!

242
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,225
- ... slutty... slut soul!
- Ow! Ow!

243
00:09:40,226 --> 00:09:41,239
- Let's go!
- Ow! Ow!

244
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,719
- Get to that portal, you slut.
- Grandpa, do something,

245
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,840
or I will tweet, and
you will be canceled.

246
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,760
Hey, Dandruff the Great,

247
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,777
lighten up and give the kid his dragon.

248
00:09:50,778 --> 00:09:52,039
By whose command?

249
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,238
You have no magic.

250
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:55,156
Yeah, I know. I have actual power.

251
00:09:55,157 --> 00:09:56,570
Not here, you don't.

252
00:09:56,574 --> 00:09:59,799
True power looks like this...

253
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,809
Stone monster.

254
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,179
- Stick that up your ass.
- Oh, you're done?

255
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,961
I thought the rock monster was
here to introduce a physicist.

256
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,999
Spinal cord, uh, activate morphine.

257
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,209
Oh, I might be [BLEEP].

258
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,000
Lightning bridge!

259
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,889
Okay, he's gone. Listen up.

260
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,219
There's probably animals in these hills.

261
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,639
If you spare me, I can make
your crotch a salt lick.

262
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,941
Agana aksaka sapooloo.

263
00:10:31,202 --> 00:10:32,519
Thank you, Morty.

264
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,839
Figures you'd be higher
status in lame world.

265
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,720
Get your [BLEEP] together, lair wrecker.

266
00:10:36,725 --> 00:10:38,140
We need to rescue Balthromaw.

267
00:10:38,149 --> 00:10:41,209
Morty, the moral of this story
is bros before dragons.

268
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,219
You know what I'm talking about?

269
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,670
Yeah, if he dies while you're
soul bonded, you die too.

270
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:49,150
Morty, the moral of this story
is bros rescue dragons.

271
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,999
Balthromaw,

272
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,339
by soul bonding with multiple riders,

273
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,920
you have violated the treaty
between dragon and mankind.

274
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:01,200
The dragonarchy sentences you
to hang by the neck until dead.

275
00:11:01,204 --> 00:11:03,099
On the count of three.

276
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,099
One dragonarchy,

277
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,629
two dragonarchy, 2 1/2...

278
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,274
I just wanted to make sure... Three!

279
00:11:11,692 --> 00:11:13,999
Grandpa Rick, what's wrong?

280
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,719
Oh, God. The wizard must
have hung Balthromaw!

281
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,379
Well, [BLEEP] it. Can we go back then?

282
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,460
W-well, no, no. It takes, like, 78 years

283
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,729
to hang a dragon to death, so...

284
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,579
Aw, man. It's so annoying.

285
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,010
You ever, like, try to
swallow a really big vitamin

286
00:11:26,016 --> 00:11:27,499
with no water? Ugh!

287
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,919
You know, like...

288
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,739
really, like, big one, you know,

289
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,294
and it kind of gets, ugh,
stuck in your throat?

290
00:11:33,295 --> 00:11:35,060
It's... it's annoying. All right.

291
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,400
Morty, go ahead and activate this golem.

292
00:11:37,404 --> 00:11:39,889
Agana aksaka sapooloo.

293
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,479
[BLEEP] dumb. All right.

294
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,179
Who wants to be infused with,
like, uh, unreasonable power?

295
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,322
Oh, can I be, like, a
sexy arrow-shooty lady?

296
00:11:59,323 --> 00:12:02,509
Yeah, whatever. There's
no rules. I don't care.

297
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,439
Morty, you want superpowers?

298
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,453
No, thanks. I'm fine. I've got my book.

299
00:12:06,454 --> 00:12:07,900
All right. Good luck with that.

300
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:09,619
Let's go.

301
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,689
God, it's like... have you ever
had too much orange juice,

302
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:15,439
or, like, you know how egg yolk

303
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,119
kind of, like, gets in your throat?

304
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,716
Yeah, we get it. Come on and hurry.

305
00:12:18,717 --> 00:12:20,677
W-we got to free Balthromaw.

306
00:12:20,678 --> 00:12:22,680
- Upsulu...
- I got this.

307
00:12:26,016 --> 00:12:28,179
Morty, how's that book
working out for you,

308
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,229
you [BLEEP] d-d-dumb-ass?

309
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,060
Huh. You know what? You're right.

310
00:12:35,067 --> 00:12:37,389
I could get used to this magic stuff.

311
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,410
There's Balthromaw.

312
00:12:47,413 --> 00:12:48,780
Check this shit out. Watch this.

313
00:12:48,786 --> 00:12:49,949
Oh, yeah, yeah. Don't even look.

314
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,079
Don't even bother looking.

315
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,917
Just [BLEEP] let magic guide your arrow.

316
00:12:52,918 --> 00:12:54,829
Summer, what the hell are you doing?

317
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,119
- Take this seriously.
- Shut the [BLEEP] up, Morty.

318
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,659
Stop trying to pretend like magic
involves skill or thought.

319
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,509
Summer, make it look like it's
coming out of your butthole.

320
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,636
Yeah, yeah.

321
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,970
Ah!

322
00:13:04,972 --> 00:13:08,219
Oh, [BLEEP], my [BLEEP] eye, oh!

323
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,119
What in the medieval
equivalent of tarnation...

324
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,040
Jesus Christ!

325
00:13:13,045 --> 00:13:14,830
Summer, you [BLEEP] idiot!

326
00:13:14,838 --> 00:13:16,489
Power of 12 feet.

327
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,039
Uh, ow, [BLEEP]!

328
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,193
I take it all back!

329
00:13:19,194 --> 00:13:21,350
I [BLEEP] hate magic!

330
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,949
Ah!

331
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:26,993
Slut thief!

332
00:13:26,994 --> 00:13:29,162
You're a slut thief!

333
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:34,119
Pretty fun boat, fun people.

334
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,479
That's great, not being
asked why I can talk.

335
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,299
I'm a talking cat, but "who
cares why?" is my point.

336
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,803
Well, nice talking to you for no reason.

337
00:13:46,437 --> 00:13:47,970
Jorge, that was a good one,

338
00:13:47,971 --> 00:13:49,879
but do you know what a
peanut butter gargoyle is?

339
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,060
Nah, what's that?

340
00:13:51,065 --> 00:13:52,970
Dude, it's when you take the chick,

341
00:13:52,979 --> 00:13:55,019
- put her feet on a cathedral...
- Sorry to interrupt, guys.

342
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:58,110
Just want to clarify, are
these real sex positions?

343
00:13:58,119 --> 00:13:59,430
Because if they are,

344
00:13:59,432 --> 00:14:01,789
how are they gratifying
to the male at all?

345
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,829
And if the goal is to make something up,

346
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:07,529
why not make up something... funnier?

347
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:10,789
I'm asking too many questions, aren't I?

348
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,329
How ironic.

349
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,559
Get out of Florida,

350
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,880
- you overthinking cat.
- Why don't you go overthink

351
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:16,629
[BLEEP] up north in Georgia?

352
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,045
Hate that cat.

353
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,440
You got any money for a cab?

354
00:14:29,444 --> 00:14:30,950
Why ask questions?

355
00:14:30,952 --> 00:14:32,579
Why not just have fun?

356
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,143
I deserve that.

357
00:14:34,144 --> 00:14:36,890
Attention, citizens of Draygon,

358
00:14:36,894 --> 00:14:39,720
a slut dragon has escaped.

359
00:14:39,722 --> 00:14:43,050
Anyone caught harboring
it is also a slut.

360
00:14:43,058 --> 00:14:44,660
- That's how it goes.
- Ow, my eye.

361
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:47,570
It pains me that you can feel my pain.

362
00:14:47,573 --> 00:14:48,699
Yeah, how about you suck your [BLEEP].

363
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,690
Which is also somehow my [BLEEP]?

364
00:14:50,691 --> 00:14:54,209
Aw, why can't couples that start
out cheating ever end up happy?

365
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:55,259
M-maybe I can find

366
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,720
that wizard's portal spell
in here and g-get us home.

367
00:14:57,722 --> 00:14:59,470
How about finding the
spell that unbinds me

368
00:14:59,472 --> 00:15:00,700
from your [BLEEP] dragon?

369
00:15:00,706 --> 00:15:02,672
No spells can do that.

370
00:15:02,673 --> 00:15:05,133
Only the wizard can unbind soul bonds.

371
00:15:05,134 --> 00:15:06,175
Uh, who the [BLEEP] are you?

372
00:15:06,176 --> 00:15:07,850
Who are we? Who the
[BLEEP] are you, bitch?

373
00:15:07,855 --> 00:15:10,379
Debrah, stop. We are the slut dragons.

374
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,499
We live in these slut
caves where we [BLEEP],

375
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,560
suck, and eat [BLEEP] and
we kindly ask that you leave.

376
00:15:15,561 --> 00:15:18,020
If the wizard knows we are
here, he will imprison us.

377
00:15:18,021 --> 00:15:19,360
Yeah! We like it down here

378
00:15:19,362 --> 00:15:21,689
'cause we can [BLEEP]
woolly mammoths. Get out!

379
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,219
- Get the [BLEEP] out of here, Michael!
- Shut up, Michael!

380
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,760
You're the only one that
[BLEEP] that thing.

381
00:15:24,761 --> 00:15:25,903
Get the [BLEEP] out of here.

382
00:15:25,904 --> 00:15:27,799
Well, at least I'm not
into [BLEEP] play.

383
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,919
- [BLEEP] you!
- Hey, wait!

384
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,520
Everybody stop, stop!

385
00:15:30,527 --> 00:15:31,993
Listen, this is all my fault.

386
00:15:31,994 --> 00:15:34,790
I started all this when I
tried to control Balthromaw,

387
00:15:34,792 --> 00:15:36,030
and that was [BLEEP] up.

388
00:15:36,034 --> 00:15:37,619
Nobody should control anyone,

389
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,229
especially that guy up there.

390
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,759
And, um, you can eat [BLEEP]
if you want, I guess.

391
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,959
- I, uh...
- I got this, Morty.

392
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,740
Okay, listen up, slut dragons!

393
00:15:44,745 --> 00:15:46,499
Wouldn't you rather be sluts up there,

394
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,999
have a [BLEEP] world
instead of a [BLEEP] cave?

395
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,079
What's wrong with you?

396
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,500
This man with a ponytail
makes a valid point.

397
00:15:52,503 --> 00:15:55,299
All dragons are sluts deep
down, even the ones up above,

398
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,419
but we would have to kill
the wizard to be free.

399
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,620
He is too powerful.

400
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:01,079
There is a way to kill the wizard.

401
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,063
Whoa. Who's this mysterious character?

402
00:16:03,064 --> 00:16:04,779
Shadow Jacker, you haven't come out

403
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,444
of your masturbation cave in eons.

404
00:16:06,445 --> 00:16:09,800
It's high time I emerge
from my [BLEEP] cocoon.

405
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,169
I grow tired of eavesdropping
and masturbating

406
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,569
to the sounds you all make.

407
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,719
Jesus Christ. All right.
C-could use a little more mystery.

408
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,453
Oh, oh, just now seeing the staff.

409
00:16:17,454 --> 00:16:20,779
We've never had enough
sluts to defeat the wizard.

410
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,279
Now, with the four fresh, wet sluts

411
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:27,006
that just landed on our doorstep,
we finally have a chance.

412
00:16:27,007 --> 00:16:28,716
So killing the wizard
will break my soul bond.

413
00:16:28,717 --> 00:16:31,310
Yes, it solves all of our problems.

414
00:16:31,316 --> 00:16:33,553
We must begin a 10-slut soul orgy...

415
00:16:33,554 --> 00:16:35,839
- Wait, wait, what?
- ... and become the all-slut

416
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,429
slut phoenix dragon,

417
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,539
- slut.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

418
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,499
Hold on. There's got to be
something else in here.

419
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,896
There's got to be another way.
Just give me a second.

420
00:16:41,897 --> 00:16:43,649
I haven't read all this yet.

421
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,652
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.

422
00:16:47,653 --> 00:16:49,489
Maybe don't tell your
parents we did this?

423
00:17:13,512 --> 00:17:16,309
Oh, oh, no. Oh... wait, please, no!

424
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,932
Ice spell! Ice spell!

425
00:17:17,933 --> 00:17:19,879
Oh, God!

426
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,510
That just made it last longer.

427
00:17:21,513 --> 00:17:22,959
Ah, it burns longer!

428
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,648
Ah, I could have died fast!

429
00:17:29,152 --> 00:17:30,349
Thank you, strangers.

430
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,340
Well, it's your world now.
Have fun with empowerment.

431
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,329
It seems to make everyone
that gets it really happy.

432
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:37,279
All right, guys. I'll use
this to open a portal.

433
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,280
Uh, open a portal to Earth.

434
00:17:40,214 --> 00:17:41,956
Let's get the hell out of here fast.

435
00:17:41,957 --> 00:17:43,399
God, look at this piece of [BLEEP].

436
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,086
Why is there writing on it?
Who writes on a portal?

437
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,779
Should've taken me up on those
wolverine claws instead, Morty.

438
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,508
Wait, why did the dragon come?

439
00:17:52,509 --> 00:17:54,719
I was thinking we could hang out?

440
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,619
Oh, yeah. Whoa, Jesus.

441
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,849
Your dad's been texting
me this whole time?

442
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,719
Uh, he's at an airport with a cat.

443
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,540
Okay, that... That sounds... wow.

444
00:18:02,542 --> 00:18:03,650
You know, I better check on him.

445
00:18:03,652 --> 00:18:05,419
Big season finale right there, you know?

446
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,779
Better, uh... Better go right now.

447
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,639
Also, I told you not to
get a dragon, Morty.

448
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,809
This is your fault. [BLEEP] you,

449
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,890
- worst adventure ever.
- Worst adventure ever.

450
00:18:11,896 --> 00:18:15,059
Yeah, uh, I guess you better be
on your way too, Balthromaw.

451
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,810
Well, I've been thinking.

452
00:18:16,815 --> 00:18:20,380
What you said back there in the
cave really resonated with me.

453
00:18:20,386 --> 00:18:22,199
Maybe we could try again?

454
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,659
Look, to be honest,
I'm kind of grossed out

455
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,949
with the sexual nature of
how everything unfolded.

456
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,879
I didn't know how sexual dragons were.

457
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,212
I kind of just wanted to do
some D&D stuff, you know?

458
00:18:30,213 --> 00:18:32,559
And have a soul orgy with
your sister and Grandpa

459
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,091
and every dragon we could find, yeah?

460
00:18:34,092 --> 00:18:36,159
No, look, can you please just go?

461
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,803
I-I-I really want to shower.

462
00:18:37,804 --> 00:18:39,681
Maybe a quick soul bone before I go.

463
00:18:39,682 --> 00:18:40,859
I-I-I-I'm good.

464
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,269
I think I just need to be alone

465
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,060
and sort of un... unpack all this.

466
00:18:44,061 --> 00:18:45,449
What about your grandpa?

467
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:46,899
Would he want to? I can wait.

468
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,390
No, I think you better go.

469
00:18:48,396 --> 00:18:50,064
I-I'm gonna take that shower.

470
00:18:50,065 --> 00:18:52,659
If it's just warm liquid you
want trickled over your body,

471
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,999
- I could maybe...
- No, no, look.

472
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,059
I just want to be clean!

473
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,490
I-I-I feel dirty after
everything that's happened.

474
00:18:57,491 --> 00:19:00,269
How about a quick hand bond?

475
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,279
- I like doing it.
- You're embarrassing yourself.

476
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,519
I-I-I'm closing the door.

477
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,160
[BLEEP] soul teasers.

478
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:08,959
This is a cool car. I like having fun.

479
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,139
That's what I'm talking
about. Keep it moving.

480
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,500
Don't ask why I can talk.

481
00:19:12,505 --> 00:19:14,129
- Mm, mm, mm.
- Uh-huh.

482
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:16,120
For sure. For sure.

483
00:19:17,299 --> 00:19:18,399
Where are we going?

484
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,579
Quantum radiator might
need some nanowater.

485
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,056
We... We can stretch our legs.

486
00:19:28,052 --> 00:19:30,860
So, uh, why can you talk?

487
00:19:31,773 --> 00:19:32,920
What is this?

488
00:19:32,929 --> 00:19:35,234
I need you in one spot
for a clean mind scan.

489
00:19:35,235 --> 00:19:37,399
Mind scan? Look, you're overthinking it.

490
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,572
The point of a talking
cat is to have fun.

491
00:19:39,573 --> 00:19:41,620
I find the insinuation
that I can't ask questions

492
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,560
and have fun condescending.

493
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:46,239
- Y-you find it condescending, Jerry?
- Yes.

494
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,519
All right. I'm from outer space.

495
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,729
- Happy?
- No.

496
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,124
Exactly, because no answer
would be satisfying.

497
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,299
Because it's a lie.

498
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,760
Let's see the truth.

499
00:19:54,548 --> 00:19:56,039
What in the...

500
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,649
Oh, son of a bitch.

501
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,160
- Jerry, don't.
- I want to see.

502
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,930
No, you do not.

503
00:20:06,435 --> 00:20:09,900
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

504
00:20:11,022 --> 00:20:12,940
- At least now maybe...
- Get the hell out of here!

505
00:20:12,941 --> 00:20:14,470
- But I've got nowhere to go.
- Get out!

506
00:20:14,471 --> 00:20:16,259
- Get out!
- Get out!

507
00:20:24,116 --> 00:20:28,650
He was in my home where I
keep photos of my parents.

508
00:20:28,651 --> 00:20:29,969
Jerry, I have a device.

509
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,179
I-it can make us forget.

510
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:34,009
No, I don't think we should forget,

511
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:35,499
not this.

512
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,659
Someone has to remember.

513
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,560
Someone will.

514
00:20:41,327 --> 00:20:42,636
Did we crash?

515
00:20:42,637 --> 00:20:43,879
Where's the cat?

516
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,640
He, uh, ran away.

517
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,739
- Did you scan his brain?
- Yeah.

518
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,320
Did you find out why he can talk?

519
00:20:49,327 --> 00:20:50,879
He's from outer space.

520
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,646
Outer space?

521
00:20:52,647 --> 00:20:54,799
That little...

522
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,580
Of course, total mind [BLEEP].

524
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,980
Now, that's what I call draggin'.

525
00:21:35,982 --> 00:21:37,560
What? It's a joke.

526
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,735
You're a dragon draggin' your stuff.

527
00:21:39,736 --> 00:21:41,278
I understand.

528
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:43,113
So, how you doing?

529
00:21:43,114 --> 00:21:45,241
I grow weary of you humans.

530
00:21:45,242 --> 00:21:47,569
How about 50 bucks?
You weary of 50 bucks?

531
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:48,799
I'm trying to cheat on my wife.

532
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,999
I'm looking for a little
magic, a little fantasy.

533
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,009
You could use some help.

534
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,000
Let's help each other, huh? 50 bucks.

535
00:21:57,574 --> 00:21:58,799
Slut.

536
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,039
Nice.

537
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,841
Is there a reason you can speak?

538
00:22:01,842 --> 00:22:04,593
Yeah, and I'm ashamed of it.

539
00:22:04,594 --> 00:22:06,869
Then speak of it no more.

540
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:10,059
Do you wish to eat, maybe bond a little?

541
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,170
Yeah, I could bond.

542
00:22:12,175 --> 00:22:14,145
How long does it take
you to fly to Florida?
