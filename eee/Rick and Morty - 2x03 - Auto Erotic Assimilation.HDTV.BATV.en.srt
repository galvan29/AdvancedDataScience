At least he was himself.

208

This woman was a drug addict
on the verge of suicide.

Oh, my god, you guys.
I get it.

346
00:14:50,594 --> 00:14:52,728
You're afraid the big,
bad hive mind

347
00:14:52,763 --> 00:14:54,764
is gonna steal
your grandpa away.

348
00:14:54,798 --> 00:14:55,412
Actually, no.

349
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:58,234
I think Unity's great and you're
a horrible influence on it.

350
00:14:58,268 --> 00:14:59,902
- What?
- This isn't healthy, Rick.

351
00:14:59,937 --> 00:15:02,571
You know, you're really
up to no good

352
00:15:02,606 --> 00:15:04,707
around here a-at this place,
you know?

353
00:15:04,741 --> 00:15:07,677
You and Unity are like...
like leggings and mid-calf boots.

354
00:15:07,711 --> 00:15:09,078
You think you're great together,

355
00:15:09,112 --> 00:15:11,714
but you're just bringing out
the worst in each other.

356
00:15:11,748 --> 00:15:14,283
Oh, gee.
Boy, Summer. Well put.

357
00:15:14,318 --> 00:15:16,252
Uh, why don't we see
what Unity thinks?

358
00:15:16,286 --> 00:15:17,553
Unity?

359
00:15:17,587 --> 00:15:19,355
I'm just taking a little break
from stuff.

360
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:21,324
You know?
I need to relax.

361
00:15:21,358 --> 00:15:23,526
Oh, hey, w-what's this on the
news, guys?

362
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,860
Let me turn it up.

363
00:15:24,895 --> 00:15:27,830
In the news today,
this looks a lot worse than it is.

364
00:15:27,864 --> 00:15:29,498
We're really just having a
good time.

365
00:15:29,533 --> 00:15:30,866
- Karen?
- Thanks, Todd.

366
00:15:30,901 --> 00:15:34,503
Up next, are you a concerned
grandchild or just a buzzkill?

367
00:15:34,538 --> 00:15:36,405
We'll tell you how you can
know for sure.

368
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,441
I think you two are a little
outnumbered.

369
00:15:38,475 --> 00:15:40,576
Okay, well, what if
you did it for me?

370
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:44,680
What if you came with us as a
favor to us because you love us?

371
00:15:44,715 --> 00:15:46,349
What?
Dumb. Bye.

372
00:15:46,383 --> 00:15:47,750
But Rick, Summer's just---

373
00:15:47,784 --> 00:15:49,552
Summer's just a
hyper-emotional, needy little--

374
00:15:49,586 --> 00:15:51,120
What's the word I'm
looking for here?

375
00:15:51,154 --> 00:15:52,555
Uh... Human.

376
00:15:52,589 --> 00:15:53,656
It runs in the family.

377
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:56,225
I can tolerate it,
but I can't give a crap about it.

378
00:15:56,259 --> 00:15:57,660
Take a hike.

379
00:15:57,694 --> 00:16:00,930
Take care of yourself, Unity.

380
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,168
I'm not looking for judgment,
just a yes or no...

381
00:16:06,203 --> 00:16:08,104
can you assimilate a giraffe?

382
00:16:08,138 --> 00:16:09,703
- You're the worst!
- No, you're the worst!

383
00:16:09,728 --> 00:16:12,241
You don't support this family!
All you care about is yourself!

384
00:16:12,275 --> 00:16:14,243
- Is about supporting you emotionally...
- You've got two children...

385
00:16:14,277 --> 00:16:16,445
- ...but you're unsupportable.
- ...Being dragged across the cosmos...

386
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,647
- ...because it's never enough, Jerry!
- ...By your dangerously ill father!

387
00:16:18,682 --> 00:16:21,017
And you force me to watch it happen because
you'd rather lose them and lose me...

388
00:16:21,051 --> 00:16:23,486
And you don't even know what it's like to be
afraid of losing anything ...Than lose him!

389
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,088
- Because you cling and you cling
- Because you're the child, Beth!

390
00:16:26,123 --> 00:16:29,291
You, not me! You!

391
00:16:29,326 --> 00:16:30,760
- Aah!
- Aah!

392
00:16:30,794 --> 00:16:32,328
- Oh, my god.
- Aah!

393
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:39,902
Um, first of all, hello.

394
00:16:39,936 --> 00:16:42,138
Uh, my name is Blim Blam the
Korblok.

395
00:16:42,172 --> 00:16:43,806
Second of all, cards
on the table,

396
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,674
I'm a murderer that eats babies,

397
00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:48,144
and I came to this planet to
eat babies.

398
00:16:48,178 --> 00:16:52,214
However, I am also carrying a
highly infectious disease

399
00:16:52,249 --> 00:16:56,585
that I suppose you could call
"space AIDS" as you put it.

400
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:59,889
And Rick did chain me up so that
he could attempt to cure it.

401
00:16:59,923 --> 00:17:01,891
At the same time,

402
00:17:01,925 --> 00:17:03,926
Rick's motivation
to cure my disease

403
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,028
was not to save my life or
anyone else's,

404
00:17:06,063 --> 00:17:09,298
but to patent and sell the cure
for billions of blemflarcks.

405
00:17:09,332 --> 00:17:12,868
But you know the reason why I
ripped my chains out of the wall?

406
00:17:12,903 --> 00:17:15,738
And do you know why I'm never
coming back to this planet?

407
00:17:15,772 --> 00:17:19,742
Because the two of you
are the [bleep] worst!

408
00:17:19,776 --> 00:17:22,311
You both hate yourselves
and each other.

409
00:17:22,345 --> 00:17:26,315
And the idea that it has anything
to do with Rick is laughable.

410
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:28,584
I'd laugh,
but I'm biologically incapable.

411
00:17:28,618 --> 00:17:30,219
That's how alien I am.

412
00:17:30,253 --> 00:17:32,855
And even I'm sitting here
listening to the two of you

413
00:17:32,889 --> 00:17:35,758
and being like,
"What the [beep]"?

414
00:17:35,792 --> 00:17:37,927
So good luck with
your shitty marriage,

415
00:17:37,961 --> 00:17:41,297
and tell Rick I'm sorry he has
to deal with either of you.

416
00:17:41,331 --> 00:17:43,732
Blim Blam out.

417
00:17:48,371 --> 00:17:50,039
You know what?
I'm taking this.

418
00:17:54,554 --> 00:17:57,256
How do you--
What is this?

419
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:02,361
Uh, is there a slow setting?

420
00:18:02,396 --> 00:18:05,598
Best door ever.

421
00:18:12,773 --> 00:18:15,942
Okay, okay. Now make them cry,
but happy crying.

422
00:18:15,976 --> 00:18:18,110
Now make them all make fun of
the blonde one.

423
00:18:18,145 --> 00:18:19,645
Now make them all
do it on the table.

424
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,081
I can't believe you created a
whole show for me.

425
00:18:22,115 --> 00:18:23,549
Now cancel it.

426
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:24,817
Okay, now put it back on.

427
00:18:25,986 --> 00:18:27,253
All right, I'm bored.

428
00:18:27,287 --> 00:18:30,289
Rick, is there a way for you
to call Summer and Morty?

429
00:18:30,324 --> 00:18:32,925
- I feel bad that they--
- Pbht. Screw those guys.

430
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,227
Ugh. I'll be right back.

431
00:18:35,262 --> 00:18:37,296
Don't waste your brain on
those weirdos, Unity.

432
00:18:37,331 --> 00:18:39,865
They're no different from any of the
aimless chumps that you occupy.

433
00:18:39,899 --> 00:18:42,601
They just put you at the center of
their lives because you're powerful.

434
00:18:42,636 --> 00:18:44,170
And then because
they put you there,

435
00:18:44,204 --> 00:18:45,571
they want you to
be less powerful.

436
00:18:45,605 --> 00:18:46,806
Never gonna happen though,
right?

437
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,974
Never.

438
00:18:48,008 --> 00:18:50,076
Never.
Back in a flash.

439
00:18:55,082 --> 00:18:56,949
Best weekend ever, Rick.

440
00:18:56,984 --> 00:19:00,419
I agree, Rick. Let's see how
long we can go.

441
00:19:00,454 --> 00:19:03,489
Hey, Une.
You got any more--

442
00:19:05,792 --> 00:19:08,027
Rick, forgive
me for doing this in notes.

443
00:19:08,061 --> 00:19:10,296
I'm not strong enough to do it
in persons.

444
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:13,632
I realize now
that I'm attracted to you

445
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:16,135
for the same reason I
can't be with you.

446
00:19:16,169 --> 00:19:17,603
You can't change.

447
00:19:17,637 --> 00:19:19,939
And I have no problem
with that,

448
00:19:19,973 --> 00:19:22,808
but it clearly means I have a
problem with myself.

449
00:19:22,843 --> 00:19:25,011
I'm sure there's
no perfect version of me.

450
00:19:25,045 --> 00:19:28,180
I'm sure I'll just unify
species after species

451
00:19:28,215 --> 00:19:29,882
and never really be complete.

452
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,718
But I know
how it goes with us.

453
00:19:32,753 --> 00:19:35,121
I lose who I am and become
part of you.

454
00:19:35,155 --> 00:19:36,722
Because in a strange way,

455
00:19:36,757 --> 00:19:39,258
you're better at what I do
without even trying.

456
00:19:39,292 --> 00:19:44,730
Yours, and nobody else's, Unity.

457
00:19:44,765 --> 00:19:47,666
P.S., I don't know where those
coal miners were

458
00:19:47,701 --> 00:19:48,734
before they were assimilated.

459
00:19:48,769 --> 00:19:50,469
You might want to get checked.

460
00:19:53,774 --> 00:19:55,908
Hey.

461
00:19:55,942 --> 00:19:57,309
Dad.

462
00:19:58,378 --> 00:20:01,847
I, um Jerry and I

463
00:20:01,882 --> 00:20:04,450
were looking for
our weed whacker

464
00:20:04,484 --> 00:20:07,219
and found your subterranean lair

465
00:20:07,254 --> 00:20:11,590
and your alien prisoner,
and he got away.

466
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,092
And I know I sound like mom,

467
00:20:13,126 --> 00:20:14,927
but I can't sacrifice this
whole family's safety

468
00:20:14,961 --> 00:20:16,862
just because I'm afraid you'll
leave again,

469
00:20:16,897 --> 00:20:18,731
so no more alien prisoners

470
00:20:18,765 --> 00:20:23,235
and no more subterranean
excavation without consulting us.

471
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,171
- Okay.
- Okay?

472
00:20:25,205 --> 00:20:28,274
"Okay" like you're gonna
quietly teleport somewhere

473
00:20:28,308 --> 00:20:30,709
- and never come back?
- No. It's your house.

474
00:20:30,744 --> 00:20:34,046
Grandpa Rick, what happened
with Unity?

475
00:20:34,081 --> 00:20:36,582
Who? Oh, Unity.
Yeah, well...

476
00:20:36,616 --> 00:20:38,417
I mean, honestly, we're
talking about an entity

477
00:20:38,452 --> 00:20:39,885
that thrives on enslavement,
you know?

478
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,154
It's not cool.
Fun's fun, but who needs it?

479
00:20:42,189 --> 00:20:43,456

How can I assist you?

514
00:22:35,523 --> 00:22:37,636
I want to talk to
Unity, beta seven.

515
00:22:37,671 --> 00:22:38,837
I know it's in there.

516
00:22:38,872 --> 00:22:40,539
You're classified as
a hostile entity,

517
00:22:40,574 --> 00:22:42,274
and Unity doesn't
want to talk to you.

518
00:22:42,309 --> 00:22:43,642
I know your game, beta seven.

519
00:22:43,677 --> 00:22:45,110
I've met a billion of you,

520
00:22:45,145 --> 00:22:46,979
you little on-deck, in-the-wings
shoulder to cry on!

521
00:22:47,013 --> 00:22:50,049
You are classified
as a hostile entity.

522
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:51,650
Oh, you're just loving this,
mother--

523
00:22:51,685 --> 00:22:53,525
This isn't gonna shake out
like you think, pal.

524
00:22:53,553 --> 00:22:54,920
Unity's not into
other hive minds.

525
00:22:54,955 --> 00:22:56,589
It's gonna suck you
in and use you up,

526
00:22:56,623 --> 00:22:57,856
and a month from now,

527
00:22:57,891 --> 00:22:59,992
I'm gonna be making out with all
of you in a bunch of red wigs!

528
00:23:00,026 --> 00:23:02,361
Unity! Unity!

529
00:23:02,395 --> 00:23:04,730
Unity, I know you can hear me.
Get out here.

530
00:23:04,764 --> 00:23:05,998
Weapons systems engaged.

531
00:23:06,032 --> 00:23:07,700
Oh, in your dreams you have
weapon systems.

532
00:23:07,734 --> 00:23:10,402
Ugh, Rick, you said we were
going to a movie.

533
00:23:10,437 --> 00:23:11,337
We are, Morty.

534
00:23:11,371 --> 00:23:12,972
All right, beta shit seven,

535
00:23:13,006 --> 00:23:15,140
you just got saved by the
bell, bitch!

536
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:18,110
Did you get any of that?

537
00:23:18,144 --> 00:23:20,112
It's-a good show-a.

538
00:23:20,136 --> 00:23:23,136
