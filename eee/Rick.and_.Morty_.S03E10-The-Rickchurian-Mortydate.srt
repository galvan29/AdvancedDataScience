Come on, football!
Go, go!

2
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:08,442
Oh, come on.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,067
Play football!

4
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:19,826
Aaah!

5
00:00:20,904 --> 00:00:22,420
So, you're mining stuff
to craft with

6
00:00:22,478 --> 00:00:23,920
and crafting stuff to mine with?

7
00:00:23,983 --> 00:00:25,872
- Uh-huh.
- Did your dad write this game?

8
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:26,930
Mean.

9
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:33,553
Gentlemen, you're needed
by a friend in Washington!

10
00:00:33,703 --> 00:00:35,490
How clandestine.

11
00:00:37,154 --> 00:00:38,371
If they can teleport,

12
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:39,812
- why did we take...
- I just work here, Steve,

13
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:41,170
same as you!

14
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:44,162
All right.
All right, all right.

15
00:00:44,569 --> 00:00:46,779
- Mr. President.
- It's about time, gentlemen.

16
00:00:46,857 --> 00:00:48,374
- Rick, do you need to drink in here?
- Yes.

17
00:00:48,431 --> 00:00:49,475
Here's the adventure.

18
00:00:49,533 --> 00:00:51,279
Some kind of alien...
googa

19
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,340
has infested
the Kennedy Sex Tunnels.

20
00:00:53,425 --> 00:00:55,217
I want it hunted down
and taken out.

21
00:00:55,275 --> 00:00:56,670
Kennedy Sex Tunnels?

22
00:00:56,728 --> 00:00:58,240
Naturally, you'll forget
you saw them,

23
00:00:58,298 --> 00:01:00,404
along with, in order of
national embarrassment,

24
00:01:00,481 --> 00:01:02,581
the Truman Cocaine Lounge,
the McKinley Hooker Dump,

25
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:04,514
and the Lincoln Slave Coliseum.

26
00:01:04,714 --> 00:01:06,147
He didn't free them all.

27
00:01:06,224 --> 00:01:07,541
And let me know
when you're done.

28
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:08,621
Maybe then we could
get a selfie?

29
00:01:08,678 --> 00:01:10,928
Too busy, Morty.
Now tell me about this summit.

30
00:01:10,986 --> 00:01:12,990
Is it a peace one
or a regular one?

31
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:25,209
Ugh. This sucks.

32
00:01:25,309 --> 00:01:26,409
God, tell me about it.

33
00:01:26,467 --> 00:01:28,049
Oh, man.
If you're not into it...

34
00:01:28,107 --> 00:01:29,797
What do you mean?
Why would I be into it?

35
00:01:29,855 --> 00:01:31,920
- It's lame.
- You're into lame stuff, Morty.

36
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:34,123
I thought young dumb people
considered it an honor

37
00:01:34,181 --> 00:01:36,131
to work for presidents
or whatever the shit.

38
00:01:36,189 --> 00:01:38,584
Maybe the first few times,
but this just sucks.

39
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:40,373
He treats us like Ghostbusters.

40
00:01:40,431 --> 00:01:42,265
- We should talk to him.
- Yeah, that sounds fun.

41
00:01:42,322 --> 00:01:44,664
Let's set some boundaries
with a spoiled control freak

42
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:45,693
that thinks he runs the world

43
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:48,111
and orders drone strikes
to cope with his insecurity.

44
00:01:48,169 --> 00:01:50,334
It's either that
or more of this.

45
00:01:50,531 --> 00:01:51,725
Third choice...

46
00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:53,458
- "Minecraft."
- You like it now?

47
00:01:53,516 --> 00:01:54,556
Got to be honest, Morty.

48
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:55,678
It's growing on me.

49
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,136
Notify the president.

50
00:01:57,194 --> 00:01:58,222
What do I tell him?

51
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,482
Tell him the truth.

52
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:03,115
Tell him Rick and Morty
just blew off America.

Should we drone-strike

- That would prove them right!
- And blow him up.

Give me the phone.

Hi, guys.
U.S. President calling.

00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:22,965
- How's it going?
- Oh, hey.

83
00:03:23,023 --> 00:03:24,973
Just hard at work
on this sex tunnel gagoo.

84
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:27,032

85
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,118
It might take a while.

86
00:03:28,176 --> 00:03:29,477
What do you think,
Morty... a month?

87
00:03:29,534 --> 00:03:31,254
Fingers crossed, a month,
yeah.

88
00:03:32,425 --> 00:03:33,625
You lying dicks!

89
00:03:33,692 --> 00:03:35,282

93
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:41,345
Okay, obviously, this looks
bad, Mr. President.

94
00:03:41,403 --> 00:03:42,720
I mean, what doesn't look bad

95
00:03:42,778 --> 00:03:43,869
through an illegal
spy satellite?

96
00:03:43,926 --> 00:03:45,239
Don't high-road me.

97
00:03:45,297 --> 00:03:47,020
The two of you break
1,000 federal laws a day.

98
00:03:47,078 --> 00:03:48,484
- Wow, really?
- That's pretty cool.

99
00:03:48,514 --> 00:03:50,868
And, yes, yes, yes, yes,
you save the world now and then.

100
00:03:50,926 --> 00:03:52,208
America returns that favor

101
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:54,634
by not holding the two of you
accountable to its laws.

102
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,407
- Oh!
- Oh! Oh, God.

103
00:03:56,465 --> 00:03:58,137
We... We didn't know
you saw it that way.

104
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,978
Well, it's nobody's fault.

105
00:04:00,036 --> 00:04:01,829
We never had "the talk,"
so to speak.

106
00:04:01,895 --> 00:04:02,943
Yeah. I mean,
the way we see it,

107
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,617
when we show up,
that's the favor to you.

108
00:04:05,734 --> 00:04:07,814
Especially, you know,
when it turns out

109
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,854
you wanted someone to come over
just because you found

110
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:11,478
an "X-Files" monster
in your basement.

111
00:04:11,536 --> 00:04:14,739
As for the reason you've never,
like, arrested us,

112
00:04:14,817 --> 00:04:16,786
we assumed you just knew
that it was impossible,

113
00:04:16,844 --> 00:04:18,262
like, if you tried.

114
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,668
You know, it wouldn't go well.

115
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:24,661
Wouldn't go well?
Can you elaborate?

116
00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:27,614
I think one of your 1,000 laws
says, no, I can't elaborate.

117
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:29,540
Just trust me.
None of us want to go there.

118
00:04:29,598 --> 00:04:30,989
Which we'll never have to.

119
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,950
By the way, we'll keep on
saving the Earth.

120
00:04:33,012 --> 00:04:34,607
You know, we're...
we're happy to do that.

121
00:04:34,664 --> 00:04:36,072
Yeah, but not because
it contains America...

122
00:04:36,129 --> 00:04:38,731
because moving to a new version
of Earth is a bitch and a half.

123
00:04:38,801 --> 00:04:41,392
But feel free to call us, you
know, as... as, like, friends.

124
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,825
Yeah, like, if you ever
want to take a selfie...

125
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,887

00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:02,230
Not needed here. You can leave
and nobody will care.

176
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:03,222
Have you never heard
that before?

177
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,839
Do you even know how to take out
this kind of threat?

178
00:07:04,897 --> 00:07:06,014
We're not taking it out.

179
00:07:06,072 --> 00:07:08,655
We're going to shrink down and
approach them diplomatically.

180
00:07:12,418 --> 00:07:14,761
- You shrink with pills?
- Are you still here?

181
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:16,801
Shouldn't you be going down
to your next version of Earth

182
00:07:16,858 --> 00:07:18,917
with your selfie-craving
star... sidekick?

183
00:07:18,975 --> 00:07:20,683
- Whoa!
- We're allowed to be here.

184
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:22,222
You aren't president
of the Amazon.

185
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,905
Yeah, I learned about
your job in school.

186
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:25,164
You're a civil servant.

187
00:07:25,204 --> 00:07:26,639
We're technically your boss.

188
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:27,850
Oh, please, Morty.

189
00:07:27,908 --> 00:07:29,460
You pay as many taxes
as you have pubes.

190
00:07:29,517 --> 00:07:32,222
Oh, I got pubes,
Commander-in-Queef.

191
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,331
- You want to count them?
- Commander-in-Queef.

192
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:36,249
That's it! Do it!

193
00:07:36,545 --> 00:07:38,792
Recognize the rare element
Sanchez-eum?

194
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,343
We've been preparing for a Rick-level
eventuality for some time.

195
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,672
You mean you've been ordering
other people to prepare for it

196
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:45,459
while you sat on your ass
at peace summits.

197
00:07:45,517 --> 00:07:46,506
Peace summits are important!

198
00:07:46,564 --> 00:07:47,584
Oh, yeah!
They work great!

199
00:07:47,642 --> 00:07:49,269
We're really drowning
in peace!

200
00:07:49,327 --> 00:07:50,987
- You suck!
- You suck!

201
00:07:51,045 --> 00:07:52,694
Task Force Alpha,
prepare to shrink.

202
00:07:52,752 --> 00:07:55,694
Is there a Task Force Alpha
health plan, by the way?

203
00:07:55,752 --> 00:07:58,081
Because if those pills are based
on subatomic compression,

204
00:07:58,139 --> 00:07:59,664
you could get a more
curable cancer

205
00:07:59,704 --> 00:08:01,561
just walking through
the mushroom clouds.

206
00:08:01,793 --> 00:08:03,569
God damn it!
I'll do it.

207
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,298
Whoa.

208
00:08:05,356 --> 00:08:06,749
Task Force Alpha is disbanded.

209
00:08:06,874 --> 00:08:08,804
And you two aren't
American anymore!

210
00:08:08,862 --> 00:08:10,561
I can say that.
You're expatriated!

211
00:08:10,714 --> 00:08:12,624
If you step foot
on homeland soil again,

212
00:08:12,744 --> 00:08:14,303
I'll treat it as an invasion.

213
00:08:14,573 --> 00:08:15,629
Is this supposed to be painful?

214
00:08:15,686 --> 00:08:16,784
Painful to watch.

215
00:08:16,814 --> 00:08:18,381
Oh, such lame shrinking.

216
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:20,452
Oh, his clothes
stay the same size?

217
00:08:20,595 --> 00:08:23,265
Oh! '70s shrinking,
party of one.

218
00:08:23,323 --> 00:08:25,100
Eat my shrinking ass!

219
00:08:26,523 --> 00:08:29,053
There he goes. All right.
Let's get out of here, Morty.

220
00:08:30,624 --> 00:08:31,631
What the hell?!

221
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:33,944
I made Sanchez-eum up,
dumbasses.

222
00:08:34,002 --> 00:08:35,913
Don't believe everything
you read on Wikipedia.

223
00:08:35,971 --> 00:08:36,980
Stand down.

224
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:38,616
He's not afraid of pirates.

225
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,571
Oh! Run, Morty!
That part was true!

226
00:08:57,254 --> 00:08:59,597
- I-I can't talk now, sweetie.
- Oh, when can you?

227
00:08:59,655 --> 00:09:00,995
Good point.
What's up?

228
00:09:01,053 --> 00:09:03,605
Remember a little while ago
when you said that, if I wanted,

229
00:09:03,663 --> 00:09:06,355
I could, like, leave Earth
and wander the infinite cosmos

230
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:08,824
to figure out who I am and that
nobody would ever know I'd left

231
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,134
because you could
replace me with a clone?

232
00:09:11,192 --> 00:09:12,546
- Mm-hmm.
- Am I the clone?

233
00:09:12,604 --> 00:09:13,933
- Sorry. What?
- Am I the clone?

234
00:09:13,991 --> 00:09:15,445
Did the real me choose to leave,
and I only

235
00:09:15,502 --> 00:09:17,421
think I chose to stay because
that's what I need to think

236
00:09:17,478 --> 00:09:19,134
because I'm
the replacement Beth?

237
00:09:19,814 --> 00:09:21,249
- No.
- Okay.

238
00:09:21,554 --> 00:09:25,561
And one more thing.
If I were a clone, would you tell me?

239
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:28,566
Beth, you know, when...
when smart people get happy,

240
00:09:28,624 --> 00:09:30,639
they stop recognizing
themselves.

241
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:34,100
And you are very smart because
you're very much my daughter.

242
00:09:34,178 --> 00:09:36,741
Oh, God. You're right.
I'm sorry.

243
00:09:36,852 --> 00:09:37,913
Thank you, Dad.

244
00:09:37,975 --> 00:09:39,050
- All good?
- Totally.

245
00:09:39,108 --> 00:09:40,545
I'm fine now.

246
00:09:40,819 --> 00:09:43,691
And just to be sure, you're not
pretending to be convinced you're real

247
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,613
because you're actually
convinced you're a clone

248
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,348
and you're now terrified
that becoming self-aware

249
00:09:47,405 --> 00:09:49,249
would mean I'd have
to terminate you?

250
00:09:50,098 --> 00:09:52,158
- No.
- Okay. Glad I could help.

251
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,346
See you soon.

252
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,084
Aaaaaah!

253
00:10:05,437 --> 00:10:07,193
Where do I go?

254
00:10:07,937 --> 00:10:10,316
What does th... What... What...
What... What does this mean?

255
00:10:10,374 --> 00:10:11,428
This means nothing.

256
00:10:11,514 --> 00:10:13,183
Pull forward and park.

257
00:10:13,241 --> 00:10:14,991
Then say that, God damn it!

258
00:10:15,233 --> 00:10:16,316
Sorry.

259
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:17,834
Bad day.

260
00:10:19,904 --> 00:10:22,511
I am Presidentress of
the Mega Gargantuans.

261
00:10:22,569 --> 00:10:24,928
We named ourselves
before learning we were small.

262
00:10:24,986 --> 00:10:27,686
Madam Presidentress,
I'm President of America,

263
00:10:27,744 --> 00:10:28,854
which is basically the world,

264
00:10:28,884 --> 00:10:30,225
but you didn't hear that
from me.

265
00:10:30,288 --> 00:10:31,936
- I've come to...
- I know who you are.

266
00:10:32,053 --> 00:10:33,824
We've already agreed
to a ceasefire

267
00:10:33,882 --> 00:10:35,558
with your ambassadors,
Rick and Morty.

268
00:10:35,616 --> 00:10:37,496
Rick and Morty were here?
Of course they were here.

269
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,288
They can shrink
instantly and teleport.

270
00:10:39,436 --> 00:10:41,364
They told me to give you this.

271
00:10:41,514 --> 00:10:43,764
They said it will stretch
as your cancer pill wears off

272
00:10:43,822 --> 00:10:46,600
and your body awkwardly enlarges
at the rate of a '50s movie.

273
00:10:46,664 --> 00:10:47,788
Are there pants?

274
00:10:47,864 --> 00:10:49,864
They said you'd prefer
just a shirt.

275
00:10:49,922 --> 00:10:52,975
Apparently, you have a need
to swing your dick around?

276
00:10:54,756 --> 00:10:55,913
Rick and Morty escaped.

277
00:10:55,974 --> 00:10:57,749
No shit.
Take me to the Pentagon.

278
00:10:57,807 --> 00:10:59,217
We're at war
with Rick and Morty.

279
00:10:59,275 --> 00:11:00,882
You'll want to make a stop
at the White House?

280
00:11:00,939 --> 00:11:03,319
I have pants at the Pentagon,
Rhonda. It's in my contract.

281
00:11:03,384 --> 00:11:05,314
I mean you need to call
a press conference.

282
00:11:05,372 --> 00:11:07,991
Israel and Palestine have
announced a permanent ceasefire.

283
00:11:08,053 --> 00:11:09,784
What?
They signed something called

284
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:12,124
"The Pretty Obvious If You
Think About It" accord.

285
00:11:12,182 --> 00:11:14,597
Apparently, an anonymous
American diplomat

286
00:11:14,655 --> 00:11:16,706
took them
to a "Star Wars" cantina,

287
00:11:16,764 --> 00:11:18,569
where they smoked
perspective-enhancing

288
00:11:18,627 --> 00:11:20,776
alien pheromones
through a laser hookah.

289
00:11:20,834 --> 00:11:22,186
I still say it has to be Putin.

290
00:11:22,246 --> 00:11:23,894
It was Rick and Morty,
you ...ing  dunce!

291
00:11:23,952 --> 00:11:25,137
But you're getting
the credit, sir.

292
00:11:25,194 --> 00:11:27,128
Your approval rating
just hit 100%

293
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,480
Why would Rick
and Morty want that?

294
00:11:28,537 --> 00:11:30,038
Because they're assholes!

295
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:34,154
I'm flattered, but it takes a whole
team to achieve what we did today.

296
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,427
Thank you.

297
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:37,455
Well?
They haven't been back home, sir.

298
00:11:37,513 --> 00:11:39,942
We've got every possible
location under surveillance.

299
00:11:40,255 --> 00:11:41,971
God damn it!
They're right here!

300
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:44,096
They're here, God damn it!
Code Red! We need backup!

301
00:11:44,154 --> 00:11:45,252
Everybody relax.

302
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,597
Just waiting for you
in the only room

303
00:11:46,654 --> 00:11:48,076
you can't blow up or spy on.

304
00:11:48,154 --> 00:11:49,963
So, we're not changing
timelines for you,

305
00:11:50,021 --> 00:11:51,448
but now you have
everything you want,

306
00:11:51,505 --> 00:11:52,729
so you can forget we exist,

307
00:11:52,787 --> 00:11:53,760
and we'll return the favor.

308
00:11:53,818 --> 00:11:55,192
You couldn't say that in a text?

309
00:11:55,232 --> 00:11:57,763
Well, since we won't be seeing
each other again, my...

310
00:11:57,857 --> 00:12:00,326
Guys, we get it.
It's a Code Red. Enough.

311
00:12:00,451 --> 00:12:01,951
My grandson has
worked hard for you,

312
00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:03,632
and I feel like
he's earned a selfie.

313
00:12:03,693 --> 00:12:05,709
Honestly, I could take it or leave
it at this point.

314
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:06,619
You're taking it.

315
00:12:06,677 --> 00:12:08,604
No. What kind of fratty-ass
status move is that?

316
00:12:08,662 --> 00:12:09,713
Get out of my office!

317
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,252
Seriously?
You're that stubborn?

318
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,073
He's the stubborn one.
I'm protecting my country.

319
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,240
Uh, from selfies?

320
00:12:14,341 --> 00:12:15,900
From subordination
to hostile powers.

321
00:12:15,966 --> 00:12:17,799
Uh, does China know about
that deal-breaker?

322
00:12:17,857 --> 00:12:19,443
China doesn't piss
on the White House.

323
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:21,385
Well, why would they?
I'm sure it was expensive.

324
00:12:21,442 --> 00:12:22,760
- Get out.
- Not without a selfie.

325
00:12:22,817 --> 00:12:25,041
- Arrest them.
- Son, you have a right to refuse his order,

326
00:12:25,098 --> 00:12:26,799
and I guarantee you're going
to die if you touch me,

327
00:12:26,856 --> 00:12:28,854
and there's no afterlife.
Everything just goes black.

328
00:12:28,911 --> 00:12:29,966
Don't do it.

329
00:12:30,067 --> 00:12:31,062
- Whoa, Rick!
- Okay.

330
00:12:31,092 --> 00:12:31,992
What was that?

331
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,132
- Death.
- What kind?

332
00:12:33,162 --> 00:12:34,330
- Instant.
- There was no sound.

333
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:36,056
- He just died.
- Yeah, terrifying.

334
00:12:36,114 --> 00:12:37,534
It's a terrifying thing
to watch happen.

335
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:38,572
It's called a deterrent.

336
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,954
You couldn't just knock him out?

337
00:12:40,012 --> 00:12:41,876
How is knocking out a deterrent?

338
00:12:41,941 --> 00:12:43,369
Everyone wants to be
knocked out.

339
00:12:43,427 --> 00:12:44,501
Nobody wants to be dead.

340
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:45,955
You committed murder
in the Oval Office.

341
00:12:46,012 --> 00:12:47,470
- Now you can't leave.
- That's fine.

342
00:12:47,528 --> 00:12:48,737
I said I'm not leaving
without a selfie.

343
00:12:48,794 --> 00:12:50,025
Uh, I don't need a selfie.

344
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,362
And I'm saying
you aren't getting one

345
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:52,369
and you aren't leaving.

346
00:12:52,427 --> 00:12:54,869
- So we agree?
- Yes. No. We disagree

347
00:12:54,927 --> 00:12:56,799
because you think you're getting
a selfie and leaving.

348
00:12:56,856 --> 00:12:57,876
Am I getting a selfie?

349
00:12:57,934 --> 00:12:59,245
- Never.
- Then I'm never leaving.

350
00:12:59,302 --> 00:13:00,322
- Exactly.
- See?

351
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,392
Does anyone have a shot?

352
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,473
Yes, nine people.
I can show you.

353
00:13:03,714 --> 00:13:05,369
But I wouldn't recommend...

354
00:13:05,427 --> 00:13:06,427
Open fire!

355
00:13:06,739 --> 00:13:07,935
God, you are dumb!

356
00:13:07,993 --> 00:13:09,034
Get the President out of here!

357
00:13:09,091 --> 00:13:10,697
- Bad idea.
- Wait. Why?

358
00:13:10,755 --> 00:13:11,971
Because if there isn't
someone in here

359
00:13:12,028 --> 00:13:13,323
that they're not
supposed to kill,

360
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,104
they're going to wreck
the place trying to kill me.

361
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,200
As long as you live,
no matter where you are,

362
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:18,915
if it isn't in
a selfie with him,

363
00:13:18,973 --> 00:13:20,412
I'll be here.

364
00:13:20,817 --> 00:13:22,204
- Jesus!
- He's not a ...ing God!

365
00:13:22,262 --> 00:13:23,470
You don't know what I am!

366
00:13:23,528 --> 00:13:24,627
And you don't know
what I can do!

367
00:13:24,684 --> 00:13:26,965
- Jesus! It's... It's cool, Rick!
- I'm Doctor Who in this mother ... !

368
00:13:27,111 --> 00:13:29,278
I could be a clone.
I could be a hologram.

369
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,087
We could be clones
controlled by robots

370
00:13:31,145 --> 00:13:32,439
controlled with special headsets

371
00:13:32,497 --> 00:13:33,752
that the real Rick and Morty
are wearing

372
00:13:33,809 --> 00:13:34,905
while they're ...ing
your mother!

373
00:13:34,963 --> 00:13:35,967
I'm going to kill you!

374
00:13:36,025 --> 00:13:37,658
Then come to 312 Olive Street!

375
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:38,909
- Is that her address?
- You don't know

376
00:13:38,966 --> 00:13:40,314
because you're a bad son!

377
00:13:40,372 --> 00:13:41,467
Ow!
Take him down!

378
00:13:41,525 --> 00:13:42,849
Semper fi!

379
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:43,979
Aaaaah!

380
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:45,779
<i>Number three, The Twister.</i>

381
00:13:45,838 --> 00:13:47,389
Ow! Damn it.
<i>Number four...</i>

382
00:13:47,419 --> 00:13:49,135
<i>The Hanky Panky.</i>

383
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:51,760
Beth?

384
00:13:51,849 --> 00:13:53,960
My dad might have cloned me,
and I might be the clone.

385
00:13:54,017 --> 00:13:55,828
And he says I'm not, but that's
what he'd say to a clone.

386
00:13:55,885 --> 00:13:56,901
Typical.

387
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,571
<i>Number six, The Texas Ripple.</i>

388
00:13:58,629 --> 00:13:59,659
You look like you to me.

389
00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:00,999
What are you, an idiot?

390
00:14:01,311 --> 00:14:02,738
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

391
00:14:02,796 --> 00:14:03,983
That was so rude.

392
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:06,223
I came to you for help, and now
I'm insulting your intelligence.

393
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,617
And look where
intelligence gets you.

394
00:14:07,674 --> 00:14:09,925
Well, don't knock intelligence,
because right now

395
00:14:10,062 --> 00:14:12,639
I'd love to understand
how I can help you.

396
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:14,269
I can't be in charge
of that, Jerry.

397
00:14:14,327 --> 00:14:16,812
My mind, my ideas are all
part of the variable.

398
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,667
The only constant is you.

399
00:14:18,789 --> 00:14:21,163
You know me inside and out.

400
00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:23,249
Do what you have to do.

401
00:14:24,911 --> 00:14:26,374
Okay. Sit down.

402
00:14:26,496 --> 00:14:27,896
Now cross your legs.

403
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,471
That leg on top. Good.

404
00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:31,327
Oh, what is this?

405
00:14:32,929 --> 00:14:34,722
Senior year,
I took you on a date

406
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,099
to the Milwaukee
Symphony Orchestra

407
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:38,899
performing the music
of Alan Silvestri in the Park.

408
00:14:39,382 --> 00:14:41,574
At this point in the song
from "Volcano,"

409
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,624
when Tommy Lee Jones
and the utility workers

410
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,925
are using cars to guide
the lava into a cul-de-sac,

411
00:14:46,031 --> 00:14:47,761
I realized my palms
were so sweaty,

412
00:14:47,831 --> 00:14:49,255
I would never get
to hold your hand.

413
00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:50,749
But I was desperate
to touch you,

414
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,806
so I wiped my palm
on the grass next to me.

415
00:14:52,864 --> 00:14:54,838
But a Snickers wrapper
kind of got stuck on it,

416
00:14:54,896 --> 00:14:56,619
so I started
kind of jiggling it,

417
00:14:56,659 --> 00:14:58,357
whipping it without
moving too much.

418
00:14:58,432 --> 00:14:59,883
But you started looking over,
and I thought,

419
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,972
"Well, this is it. She's going
to see that I'm a loser,

420
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:03,245
and I'll never get to touch her.

421
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:04,763
But I still have time
to touch her."

422
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,259
But my hand had Snickers on it,

423
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:07,724
and the brass section
was swelling

424
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,377
because it was the scene with
the guy melting in the lava.

425
00:15:09,434 --> 00:15:11,434
And I just thought, "...  it.
Lips don't sweat."

426
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,130
Wow. Yeah.

427
00:15:16,239 --> 00:15:18,317
I'll never forget that feeling.

428
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:20,161
You're the real thing.

429
00:15:20,609 --> 00:15:21,833
Then that settles it,

430
00:15:21,897 --> 00:15:24,507
because my memory
is of hating that night.

431
00:15:24,749 --> 00:15:27,950
But now, reliving it,
all I can feel is how lucky I am

432
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:32,859
to be loved by such a simple,
honest, simple man.

433
00:15:32,935 --> 00:15:34,060
Simple twice.

434
00:15:34,118 --> 00:15:36,324
This isn't the woman
you married, Jerry,

435
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:38,465
because this woman loves you.

436
00:15:38,582 --> 00:15:42,451
Uh... well,
vive la différence.

437
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:43,966
Okay. That was lame.

438
00:15:44,099 --> 00:15:46,459
Listen, I... Words.

439
00:15:47,171 --> 00:15:48,755
Don Cheadle.

440
00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:56,107
You have the right to get
the ... out of my office!

441
00:15:56,185 --> 00:15:57,630
You have the right
to kiss my dick!

442
00:15:57,719 --> 00:15:59,341
Give me the thing.

443
00:16:00,037 --> 00:16:01,263
Ugh!

444
00:16:01,474 --> 00:16:03,170
Oh!

445
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,615
Ugh!

446
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:40,052
Oh!

447
00:16:43,909 --> 00:16:45,909
Ugh! Ugh!

448
00:17:05,889 --> 00:17:07,689
Ohh!

449
00:17:07,719 --> 00:17:09,749
Submit!
Submit for the selfie!

450
00:17:09,789 --> 00:17:11,959
I yield! I yield!
Take the selfie!

451
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,347
Okay. Morty, get in there
and say, "Cheese."

452
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,293
Morty?

453
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:18,082
Morty, come on!

454
00:17:18,355 --> 00:17:20,152
God damn it!

455
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,886
Rick, don't get mad,
but I-I stole your portal gun.

456
00:17:24,972 --> 00:17:26,239
What the ... , Morty?!

457
00:17:26,269 --> 00:17:28,902
I told you I didn't want
the damn selfie 800 times!

458
00:17:29,071 --> 00:17:30,743
Look, whatever the hell
is going on between you

459
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,622
and the president,
it's got nothing to do with me.

460
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:34,355
So where did you go?
I can't tell you.

461
00:17:34,464 --> 00:17:36,691
Rick, did you tell my mom
she might be a clone?

462
00:17:36,761 --> 00:17:38,438
No! I told her she wasn't!

463
00:17:38,496 --> 00:17:40,019
Well, isn't that
what you'd tell a clone?

464
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:41,219
Oh, for Christ's sake.

465
00:17:41,249 --> 00:17:43,293
Rick, my mom and dad
are getting back together.

466
00:17:43,425 --> 00:17:44,793
What? No!
She's not a clone!

467
00:17:44,851 --> 00:17:46,883
Well, she says it doesn't
matter if she is or isn't

468
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:48,320
because now she loves my dad,

469
00:17:48,378 --> 00:17:49,972
and she wanted me
and Summer to come home,

470
00:17:50,029 --> 00:17:51,959
and we're hiding from you
so you don't kill her

471
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:53,652
if she's a clone in a place

472
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,140
I picked that
you will never find.

473
00:17:55,361 --> 00:17:57,831
So don't look for us.

474
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:00,167
Come on, bitch!

475
00:18:00,225 --> 00:18:01,281
Oh, you come on, bitch.

476
00:18:01,339 --> 00:18:02,969
I'm out. I'm done.

477
00:18:03,093 --> 00:18:05,251
I've got to...
I've got to go.

478
00:18:05,325 --> 00:18:07,582
So I win. Then I'm in charge,
and you can't leave.

479
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,221
You're a terrorist.
You're an enemy of the state,

480
00:18:09,278 --> 00:18:10,962
and you kicked me in the balls
10 minutes ago!

481
00:18:11,019 --> 00:18:12,749
The office of the President
can't coexist

482
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:14,679
with a living God
that won't submit to it...

483
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:16,249
I mean, besides Poseidon.

484
00:18:16,312 --> 00:18:17,859
But he's locked up
in Area 51 already,

485
00:18:17,968 --> 00:18:19,128
so that doesn't really count.

486
00:18:19,187 --> 00:18:20,747
Mr. President,
I'll make you a deal.

487
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:22,780
If you let me use
your ghetto-ass off-brand

488
00:18:22,866 --> 00:18:24,671
deficit-tripling teleporter,

489
00:18:24,761 --> 00:18:27,172
I can go take care of something,
and you'll never see me again.

490
00:18:27,229 --> 00:18:30,199
Yes. Deal.
Invisi-troopers, stand down.

491
00:18:30,405 --> 00:18:32,129
- Yeah, yeah.
- I don't want to hear it.

492
00:18:32,187 --> 00:18:33,890
You know I could see them
this whole time, right?

493
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,347
Don't push it, Sanchez.

494
00:18:45,883 --> 00:18:47,183
He found us!

495
00:18:47,241 --> 00:18:48,406
I told you
we shouldn't have gone

496
00:18:48,463 --> 00:18:49,882
to the same cabin as last time!

497
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,851
Oh, we're not going anywhere.
This ends now.

498
00:18:53,335 --> 00:18:55,132
Dad, if you're my dad.

499
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,382
Of course, you're not my dad.

500
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,241
You're here with a gun
because I am a clone.

501
00:18:58,434 --> 00:19:00,151
I guess I have all
your daughter's memories.

502
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:03,762
So I guess I was her,
which makes me related to her.

503
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,304
But I don't relate to her.

504
00:19:05,399 --> 00:19:08,976
She left her family and me,
which means I relate to them.

505
00:19:09,046 --> 00:19:10,309
So if you kill me, fine.

506
00:19:10,374 --> 00:19:11,421
You're not killing her.

507
00:19:11,479 --> 00:19:13,149
But you're killing
a real family.

508
00:19:13,207 --> 00:19:15,677
And instead of doing that,
will you just go away?

509
00:19:15,735 --> 00:19:17,390
Aren't there, like,
infinite time lines?

510
00:19:17,451 --> 00:19:19,831
Can't you just move to one
where I don't know I'm a clone

511
00:19:19,889 --> 00:19:22,230
and where a different
but identical version

512
00:19:22,288 --> 00:19:24,659
of your authentic
sociopathic crazy bitch

513
00:19:24,689 --> 00:19:26,819
of a daughter can keep
making you proud

514
00:19:26,859 --> 00:19:28,648
by being somewhere else?

515
00:19:29,523 --> 00:19:31,799
Beth, you crazy bitch.
You're my daughter.

516
00:19:31,874 --> 00:19:33,499
I brought this here
to kill Jerry.

517
00:19:33,557 --> 00:19:35,640
Oh, my God!
Jesus Christ!

518
00:19:35,765 --> 00:19:38,405
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
You win, Jerry. You win!

519
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:42,007
No amount of genius can stop
your dumb mediocre vacuous roots

520
00:19:42,065 --> 00:19:44,101
from digging into everything
and everyone around you

521
00:19:44,158 --> 00:19:46,854
and draining them of
any ability to fend you off.

522
00:19:46,924 --> 00:19:49,791
Well, it couldn't have been
easy for you to say that.

523
00:19:49,849 --> 00:19:50,849
I appreciate it.

524
00:19:50,949 --> 00:19:52,101
Morty, where's my portal gun?

525
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:53,194
Let's get out of here.

526
00:19:53,252 --> 00:19:54,327
I'm staying here, Rick.

527
00:19:54,385 --> 00:19:56,319
Are you... Ugh!

528
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:57,449
Nobody gets it.

529
00:19:57,489 --> 00:19:58,940
Nothing you think matters
matters.

530
00:19:59,018 --> 00:20:00,072
This isn't special.

531
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,695
This... This is happening
infinite times

532
00:20:01,752 --> 00:20:03,007
across infinite realities.

533
00:20:03,065 --> 00:20:04,518
Including this?

534
00:20:05,025 --> 00:20:06,533
Yes!

535
00:20:06,979 --> 00:20:09,769
Which is not to say that,
subjectively, it wasn't funny.

536
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:10,999
Are you going to stay?

537
00:20:11,069 --> 00:20:12,432
There's infinite
time lines, Morty.

538
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:14,734
Why would I stay in the one
where I trashed the White House,

539
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,321
became an enemy of America

540
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:19,486
and the lowest-status character
in my idiot family?

541
00:20:21,193 --> 00:20:22,993
Because of the fart?

542
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:24,819
There's still some rubble
over there.

543
00:20:24,877 --> 00:20:26,471
I don't think you've
ever understood

544
00:20:26,538 --> 00:20:29,143
what "Secretary of the Interior"
means!

545
00:20:29,489 --> 00:20:31,729
Hi, Mr. President.
I'm Rick Sanchez,

546
00:20:31,787 --> 00:20:33,260
but not the one that did this.

547
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:36,338
We Ricks travel the infinite and
switch places with each other

548
00:20:36,396 --> 00:20:37,713
like hermit crabs, I think.

549
00:20:37,771 --> 00:20:39,150
I'm fly-fishing Rick.

550
00:20:39,236 --> 00:20:41,672
You can distinguish me from the Rick
that you had a falling-out with

551
00:20:41,729 --> 00:20:44,569
by my fly-fishing enthusiasm
and accompanying hat.

552
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:46,069
I hope I can be of service

553
00:20:46,109 --> 00:20:48,033
if, uh, you ever find
the planet to be in danger.

554
00:20:48,104 --> 00:20:50,150
Friends?

555
00:20:51,121 --> 00:20:52,729
Sounds good to me.

556
00:20:52,917 --> 00:20:54,377
Kids, dinner!

557
00:20:54,449 --> 00:20:55,709
I got Panda Express!

558
00:20:55,749 --> 00:20:57,009
Did you get sugar chicken?

559
00:20:57,049 --> 00:20:58,562
That's kind of the only
thing they have.

560
00:20:58,619 --> 00:21:00,541
I love Panda E!
Thanks, Mom!

561
00:21:00,619 --> 00:21:02,850
I'm hoping to get a piece
of your sugar chicken later.

562
00:21:03,775 --> 00:21:04,942
Stop it.

563
00:21:05,019 --> 00:21:06,994
Here's your
stupid hat, dipshit.

564
00:21:07,052 --> 00:21:09,082
Dad, you can't talk to
Jerry that way anymore.

565
00:21:09,193 --> 00:21:11,018
We're a real family now.

566
00:21:11,076 --> 00:21:13,141
In many ways, things
will be like season 1

567
00:21:13,199 --> 00:21:14,459
but more streamlined.

568
00:21:14,499 --> 00:21:16,604
Now Jerry and I are happily
married parents,

569
00:21:16,662 --> 00:21:18,405
and the idea
that I was motivated

570
00:21:18,463 --> 00:21:20,236
by a fear of you leaving
can be eschewed.

571
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:22,455
Eschewed?
You've never used that word.

572
00:21:22,565 --> 00:21:23,979
Maybe you are a clone.

573
00:21:24,603 --> 00:21:26,744
It's not like
Rick would tell us.

What a season!

Sorry I never showed up,
but I got married.

580
00:22:08,154 --> 00:22:09,256
I had a baby.

581
00:22:09,314 --> 00:22:12,291
I went back to school
and got my G-E-E-E-D.

582
00:22:12,489 --> 00:22:14,697
What did you do
while you were waiting?

583
00:22:14,785 --> 00:22:18,525
Hopefully you didn't just ...
around and waste your life.

Ooh-wee!

See you for Season 4 in,
like, a really long time!

I might even have
a big white Santa Claus beard

587

and... and... and a...

588
00:22:31,369 --> 00:22:33,596
and a couple of grandkids

589
00:22:33,691 --> 00:22:36,361
and all that kind of stuff.

590
00:22:36,502 --> 00:22:38,455
See you... See you then!
