1
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:05,470
Get us out of here.
I'll hold them off.

2
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:11,388
My name is Beth Smith.

3
00:00:11,412 --> 00:00:13,790
Tell your top bugs
the Defiance lives on.

4
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:15,192
I will. I will.

5
00:00:15,216 --> 00:00:16,793
I'll make you a legend.
Blade Smith.

6
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:19,196
Beth Smith.
Beth. Beth. Beth Smith.

7
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,131
Okay, God,
it's just such a plain...

8
00:00:21,155 --> 00:00:23,133
I'm trying to come up
with a mnemonic device.

9
00:00:23,157 --> 00:00:24,668
You could connect it
to not dying.

10
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:26,870
I know, I know! You think that
would sear it right in,

11
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:29,272
but it just speaks
to the sheer forgettability.

12
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:31,608
Oh, God. I-I-I'm, uh, so sorry.

13
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:33,076
Uh, uh, oh, God.

14
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,477
Starts with a "B"...

15
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,479
<i>Congratulations to your
government, business,</i>

16
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:38,349
<i>or terror cell on its

17
00:00:38,373 --> 00:00:40,217
<i>the NX-5 Planet Remover

18
00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:42,085
<i>in partnership with

00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:43,687
<i>The NX-5's industry-leading</i>

22
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:51,094

23
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:52,629

25
00:00:53,788 --> 00:00:55,832
<i>- We say it's about time.</i>
- Damn it.

26
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:57,168
We risked our lives for that?

27
00:00:57,192 --> 00:00:59,236
You did your best.
Maybe you need a break.

28
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,104
Don't you ever miss Earth?
I don't have to miss it.

29
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:02,573
I'm technically still there.

30
00:01:02,597 --> 00:01:05,709
My dad made a perfect clone
of me to take my place.

31
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:06,910
Boy, that Rick.

32
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:08,179
So, if you do go back,

33
00:01:08,203 --> 00:01:09,580
what happens to the clone?

34
00:01:09,604 --> 00:01:12,115
Does it have, like,
a proximity-triggered device

35
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:14,117
in its neck?
Who cares? Are we done?

36
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:15,652
Sure.
Unless you want me to remove

37
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:19,256
the proximity-triggered device
from your neck.

38
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,657
Think it's a bomb?

39
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:22,259
Man, what if this is
how you found out

40
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:23,860
he never wanted you back,

41
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:26,063
that he loved the clone
more than you?

42
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:27,864
How crazy would that be?

43
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:29,666
Crazy and of...
Of course soul-crushing.

44
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,735
For you. I actually have
something for that.

45
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,336
Y-You want some?
They're nonaddictive.

46
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,272
That's not true.
They're totally addictive.

47
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:36,539
I'm a terrible doctor.

48
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:37,874
I actually have something
for that, too.

49
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:40,811
You want some?
Nonaddictive. Mmm.

50
00:01:40,835 --> 00:01:42,568
I'm a great doctor.

51
00:02:14,335 --> 00:02:15,846
Dr. Wong had
a cancellation today.

52
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,314
Anybody up for a family session?

53
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:18,782
- I could do that.
- I'm... I'm down to clown.

54
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:20,251
Ooh, not sure my therapy puppet
will be done in time.

55
00:02:20,275 --> 00:02:22,052
Great, because she
specifically asked you

56
00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:23,787
to stop bringing puppets. Dad?

57
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:26,257
I love therapy, family therapy
most of all,

58
00:02:26,281 --> 00:02:29,993
but I am actually
disintegrating.

59
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:31,061
Oh, my God! Whoa! Dad!

60
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:33,196
Is that really it? We did it?

61
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,198
It's the invisibility belt.

62
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:37,534
Whoa-whoa-whoa! He grazed them.

63
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:38,869
That's gonna hurt
in like 10 seconds.

64
00:02:38,893 --> 00:02:40,804
Thanks, Morty.
Why should I let you use it?

65
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,673
You never let me use it.
Can I have the belt?

66
00:02:42,697 --> 00:02:44,741
It would really piss off Morty.
Fantastic idea.

67
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:47,010
What the hell?!
You jerk! Give it!

68
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:48,812
Hey! Ow!

69
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,481
Share the invisibility. Jerry?

70
00:02:50,505 --> 00:02:52,215
Ooh, this looks like a job
for Mr. Nibbles.

71
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,884
Let me just glue
one more eye on.

72
00:02:53,908 --> 00:02:55,752
I'm gonna kill you!

73
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:57,354
Woof.
Looks like you two have to fight

74
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:58,689
about why you can't
control your kids.

75
00:02:58,713 --> 00:03:00,423
Good thing Dr. Wong's
got an opening.

76
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:03,026
- Bye.
- You're a bad father.

77
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,362
Don't let him divide us.

78
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:08,299
Garage, family therapy mode.

79
00:03:08,323 --> 00:03:09,755
Ah.

80
00:03:12,994 --> 00:03:14,505
Honey, you're back.

81
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:16,439
You seem surprised.
You never wrote.

82
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:19,042
And never exploded?

83
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:22,779
What I'm hearing is that
you think that's a bomb.

84
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:25,516
So does every engineer
that's seen it.

85
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,718
Engineer?
Princess, I'm sure every caveman

86
00:03:27,742 --> 00:03:29,786
that sees a microwave calls
it a rock cabinet.

87
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,279
The point of inventing is
to make things that don't exist.

88
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:39,330
Then whip me up a reason
not to kill you.

89
00:03:39,354 --> 00:03:41,598
Dad? We're off to Dr. Wong's.

90
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:44,001
Scan her.

91
00:03:44,025 --> 00:03:46,403
Dad?

92
00:03:46,427 --> 00:03:47,738
Okay, have fun, pumpkin.

93
00:03:47,762 --> 00:03:49,606
Sorry I'm a piece-of-father.

94
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,543
Oh, ha-ha! Well, the
self-loathing buys a lot back.

95
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:53,944
Jerry, leave the puppet.

96
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:56,079
It's a one-way ticket
to a breakthrough, Beth.

97
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:58,349
The device in her neck
<i>would</i> have transferred

98
00:03:58,373 --> 00:04:00,150
a database of her memories
to your device

99
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:01,284
before vaporizing her.

100
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:02,553
So much for that plan.

101
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:04,021
Why is she... it...

102
00:04:04,045 --> 00:04:05,556
Why am I back with Jerry?

103
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,890
I thought she was a copy of me.

104
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:08,225
She is a copy of you.

105
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:09,826
If she ran back to that
dingleberry,

106
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,562
that's on you.

107
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:12,896
Want to grab a drink?
All the time.

108
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,587
Good girl.

109
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:17,924
Ooh.

110
00:04:31,806 --> 00:04:34,117
- To catch a predator.
- What the hell?!

111
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:35,252
Thermal goggles, bitch.

112
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:36,720
Mom said share.

113
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:38,811
You can't share invisibility.
Take those off.

114
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:42,782
No.

115
00:04:45,286 --> 00:04:47,130
So I'll just see you
at cheerleader practice?

116
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:49,200
Should I bring a poncho?

117
00:04:49,224 --> 00:04:51,001
Alright! State your terms.

118
00:04:51,025 --> 00:04:53,070
Give back the belt.
You take the goggles.

119
00:04:53,094 --> 00:04:55,272
Go away. We trade in an hour.

120
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:56,695
Deal.

121
00:04:58,032 --> 00:04:59,276
How do you like that, bitch?

122
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,412
I liked it more
than my old belt.

123
00:05:01,436 --> 00:05:03,146
"Tiny Big Man Junior"?

124
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:06,483
You shoulda shared.

125
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:07,951
What are you doing in my house?

126
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:10,421
Did I wander that far
from my console?

127
00:05:10,445 --> 00:05:12,756
They should put a warning
on these things.

128
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,357
So, we overrode the gates,

129
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:16,760
and the slave rebellion
took the capital.

130
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:18,495
Pretty cool. Very cool.

131
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,964
My daughter,
having space adventures.

132
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:24,501
They are skewing a tad
"Star Wars" -y, though.

133
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:25,836
Don't forget to have fun.

134
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,704
Well, I came back to murder you,
not get your notes,

135
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:29,906
but I'll remember to fart more
while I'm saving the galaxy.

136
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,975
Okay, I'm the one
that made this possible.

137
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,644
It's not a competition.
Of course not.

138
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:34,978
Just curious, though,
if it were,

139
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,336
would "most wanted"
be first place?

140
00:05:39,474 --> 00:05:40,717
You're fighting
the Gromflomites?

141
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:42,253
Dad, they're trying
to take over the galaxy!

142
00:05:42,277 --> 00:05:44,921
Everybody in the galaxy
tries to take over the galaxy.

143
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:48,191
The trick is to be left alone
by whoever succeeds.

144
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:49,460
Eh, it's your hero phase.

145
00:05:49,484 --> 00:05:51,394
I had one, too.
You'll outgrow it.

146
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:52,529
No, you did.

147
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:54,197
I'm not gonna outgrow giving a.

148
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:55,999
<i>Sources tell us these aliens,
who call themselves</i>

149
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:59,136
<i>the Neeeew Galactic Federation,
will blow up the planet</i>

150
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,805
<i>unless some woman with a very
boring name gives herself up.</i>

151
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:02,940
<i>- Oh, come on.
- Way to give a.</i>

152
00:06:02,964 --> 00:06:04,808
Next time, don't wipe it
on your home planet.

153
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:06,543
Oh
They're gonna track down Beth.

154
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:08,745
You mean... Beth's clone.

155
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:11,081
Right. Beth's clone.

156
00:06:11,105 --> 00:06:12,805
What... What did I say?

157
00:06:15,977 --> 00:06:18,622
It really was nice
seeing you again.

158
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:22,493
Whoo! Yeah! Go, Honey Bees!

159
00:06:22,517 --> 00:06:24,495
Good practice, girls.

160
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,029
And remember,
we are in a drought,

161
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:27,831
so be sure to shower
as one big group

162
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:30,122
at the exact same time.

163
00:06:31,392 --> 00:06:32,903
Shower fire!
The shower's on fire!

164
00:06:32,927 --> 00:06:34,527
Step aside, girls! I got this!

165
00:06:41,135 --> 00:06:42,245
You're a monster!

166
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:43,803
Still wanna share?

167
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:51,322
<i>Morty Smith, hands up.</i>

168
00:06:51,346 --> 00:06:53,790
<i>You are under arrest
for crimes against</i>

169
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:56,059
<i>the New Improved
Galactic Federation.</i>

170
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,661
<i>Wait. What?
How are you doing that?</i>

171
00:06:57,685 --> 00:06:58,795
<i>You're not a psychic, are you?</i>

172
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:00,531
<i>Do you have psychic powers?</i>

173
00:07:00,555 --> 00:07:02,866
- Uh, yes.
- <i>-Are they strong powers?</i>

174
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,467
<i>We're just looking
for your mother.</i>

175
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:06,003
<i>You can't, like,
stop our hearts, can you?</i>

176
00:07:06,027 --> 00:07:08,539
- Uh, I can.
- <i>-Okay, we surrender.</i>

177
00:07:08,563 --> 00:07:10,874
Jerry, do you agree
that the use of puppets

178
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:12,409
makes you seem dumb and crazy?

179
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:15,879
I don't think "crazy" is
a responsible word to use in...

180
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:17,480
It is now. This is crazy.

181
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:18,349
You're being crazy.

182
00:07:18,373 --> 00:07:19,950
They do it in therapy on TV.

183
00:07:19,974 --> 00:07:23,508
Well, TV gives British people
prizes for baking, Jerry.

184
00:07:28,049 --> 00:07:30,160
Tonya? Tammy? Tammya? Tammya.

185
00:07:30,184 --> 00:07:31,628
Hi, Mrs. Smith.

186
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:32,829
I like your hair
better this way.

187
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:34,965
How's the stomach? What?

188
00:07:34,989 --> 00:07:36,967
Hey! I only said "hey."

189
00:07:36,991 --> 00:07:39,302
It's not like I can do more
than that.

190
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:40,637
As much as I'd like to kill you,

191
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:43,174
my superiors have some questions
about the Defiance.

192
00:07:43,198 --> 00:07:46,777
I don't have a...
I have a Defiance?

193
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:49,112
Oh, God, I'm a clone.

194
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,247
That's your defense?

195
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,383
No, my defense is eat me.

196
00:07:52,407 --> 00:07:54,918
Hey! Ah! We've been over this.

197
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:57,988
All I do is say "hey."

198
00:07:58,012 --> 00:08:00,457
Smart guns,
white-list human life.

199
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:02,214
And the therapist.

200
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:10,067
Tammy, this is the office
where my family works

201
00:08:10,091 --> 00:08:12,135
to better itself.
What, and that makes it sacred?

202
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,670
No, it makes it a place
I've rigged with a lot

203
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:16,073
of voice-activated
escape contingencies.

204
00:08:16,097 --> 00:08:17,674
These are all good points.

205
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:19,832
I need to take a long
look at myself.

206
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:22,946
Aah! Aah!

207
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,347
I'd like to discuss that.

208
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:25,548
I don't discuss problems,

209
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:26,417
I incinerate them.

210
00:08:26,441 --> 00:08:28,619
Everybody in the car.

211
00:08:28,643 --> 00:08:30,487
Everybody in my family,
not the world.

212
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:32,778
Jesus, Wong. Boundaries.

213
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:36,716
I'm better than this job.

214
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:42,333
Can't you just make a portal?

215
00:08:42,357 --> 00:08:44,067
Your children are down
there invisible, Jerry.

216
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:46,403
"Make a portal"?
Father of the year back here.

217
00:08:46,427 --> 00:08:47,470
Well, you're one to talk.

218
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:49,006
You told me I wasn't a clone.

219
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,941
Y-You're not a clone.

220
00:08:50,965 --> 00:08:54,000
And who is that?
Uh, uh, a clone.

221
00:08:57,972 --> 00:08:59,550
Why would you make a clone of me

222
00:08:59,574 --> 00:09:01,018
just to send the clone
into space?

223
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:02,819
Well, you didn't want to go,
and I thought,

224
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:04,355
"Okay, that's cool."

225
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:05,822
But then I thought, "Well,
you know what would be even"

226
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:08,425
cooler is a space daughter,"
s-so I made one.

227
00:09:08,449 --> 00:09:10,561
And I put a bomb in her neck
in case she ever came back.

228
00:09:10,585 --> 00:09:11,695
Father of the year.

229
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:13,096
She wasn't supposed
to come back.

230
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,031
Why did she?

231
00:09:14,055 --> 00:09:15,232
Well, she found a bomb
in her neck.

232
00:09:15,256 --> 00:09:17,568
Wouldn't you?

233
00:09:17,592 --> 00:09:19,502
Father of the year. Shut up!

234
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:20,837
I'm tired of believing you.

235
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:22,505
- I want to talk to her.
- No, you don't.

236
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:24,041
Jerry, do something.

237
00:09:24,065 --> 00:09:25,631
Hey.

238
00:09:30,004 --> 00:09:31,114
He told me you're the clone.

239
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:32,916
What do you think he told me?

240
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,452
You're the clone?
Wow, naive and attractive.

241
00:09:35,476 --> 00:09:37,542
Wow, jaded and hot.

242
00:09:39,013 --> 00:09:40,457
I know this is bad parenting,

243
00:09:40,481 --> 00:09:42,259
but if you stop fighting,
you both get McDonald's.

244
00:09:42,283 --> 00:09:45,128
How about I just blow my brains
out, starting with hers?

245
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:46,529
Okay, Wendy's. We love Wendy's.

246
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:47,998
I-I think they even
gave us some money.

247
00:09:48,022 --> 00:09:49,332
- Drop it. Don't move!
- Freeze! Get down!

248
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:51,402
On the ground! On the ground!
Don't move!

249
00:09:51,426 --> 00:09:53,804
Everybody, shut up! You're all
saying different.

250
00:09:53,828 --> 00:09:55,672
Wait, so there are two of them?

251
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:57,941
More importantly,
which one is mine?

252
00:09:57,965 --> 00:09:59,410
Uh, neither, chauvinist.

253
00:09:59,434 --> 00:10:01,566
Whatever. Take them both.

254
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:07,284
Cool beam. But let's bargain.

255
00:10:07,308 --> 00:10:08,552
I'm the one you really want.

256
00:10:08,576 --> 00:10:09,753
Excuse me?

257
00:10:09,777 --> 00:10:10,954
Uh, smartest man
in the universe?

258
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:12,623
Secret to
interdimensional travel?

259
00:10:12,647 --> 00:10:13,824
Ask your bosses.

260
00:10:13,848 --> 00:10:15,292
My bosses are bugs, Rick.

261
00:10:15,316 --> 00:10:17,360
You killed the old ones.
The new ones are half my age.

262
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:21,432
They know if you're left alone,
you're a non-threat.

263
00:10:21,456 --> 00:10:23,233
Oofa! We got the payload.

264
00:10:23,257 --> 00:10:24,768
Fire up the NX-5.

265
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:26,036
Earth's going ta-ta.

266
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,438
You might want to do that thing

267
00:10:27,462 --> 00:10:28,772
where you find a new universe

268
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:29,907
where you can yourself off.

269
00:10:29,931 --> 00:10:31,241
You can't tell me what to do.

270
00:10:31,265 --> 00:10:32,843
Awesome. He resisted.
We can shoot him.

271
00:10:32,867 --> 00:10:35,446
Wha? Just go with it, Jerry.

272
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,914
Everybody, drop your guns...
Except for Jerry!

273
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:39,938
Classic.

274
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:45,588
Holy Morty. And Summer.

275
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:47,458
W-We worked together.
That's... that's our arc.

276
00:10:47,482 --> 00:10:50,060
We went from siblings to
invisible to working together.

277
00:10:50,084 --> 00:10:51,862
It's not "Citizen Kane,"
but why compete

278
00:10:51,886 --> 00:10:54,197
with whatever's going on here,
you know?

279
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:56,600
Unh!

280
00:10:56,624 --> 00:11:00,070
Aah!

281
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:03,406
You made me go to a wedding.

282
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,542
And you killed my best friend.
I shoulda said that one first.

283
00:11:05,566 --> 00:11:10,814
<i>Congratulations, Earth,
on being destroyed by the NX-5,</i>

284
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:13,639
<i>brought to you by Wrangler.</i>

285
00:11:16,911 --> 00:11:19,356
Ugh, guess the galaxy's
most-wanted mammal

286
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,558
needs her daddy
to come change her diapie.

287
00:11:21,582 --> 00:11:23,226
Come on, kids, we have to go do

288
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,352
a piece of "Star Wars."

289
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:30,901
<i>Attention, Zeta 99-2.</i>

290
00:11:30,925 --> 00:11:33,103
We know you have a stolen ship.
Stand down.

291
00:11:33,127 --> 00:11:35,828
Oh, am I not a non-threat now?

292
00:11:43,604 --> 00:11:45,382
Hey, you are not cleared
to land.

293
00:11:45,406 --> 00:11:47,584
We will open fire.
Hold your ground, men.

294
00:11:47,608 --> 00:11:49,141
You'll be heroes.

295
00:11:52,146 --> 00:11:53,857
Summer, try unlocking
that door by scanning

296
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:55,592
your high-school
friend's dead face.

297
00:11:55,616 --> 00:11:56,727
Uh, I have... I have to pee.

298
00:11:56,751 --> 00:11:58,461
Pee on the floor.
It's a Death Star.

299
00:11:58,485 --> 00:12:00,864
Okay, but there's rebellion
and then there's...

300
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:02,333
Here, Dad. Perfect.

301
00:12:02,357 --> 00:12:05,268
What am I doing wrong?

302
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:07,738
Ugh, her eyes are closed.
Morty, open the left one.

303
00:12:07,762 --> 00:12:10,273
I've got the right.

304
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:12,409
She died the way she lived,
overserialized.

305
00:12:12,433 --> 00:12:13,810
I'm gonna rescue your mom
and her clone

306
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:15,145
without revealing
which is which.

307
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:17,014
You two find the NX-5
and shut it down.

308
00:12:17,038 --> 00:12:18,481
I mean, don't die trying.
There's infinite Earths.

309
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:20,351
If you can save this one,
it's gravy.

310
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:21,752
Dream team rides again!

311
00:12:21,776 --> 00:12:23,620
Oh, yeah, we're like
Luke and Leia.

312
00:12:23,644 --> 00:12:24,821
Uh, except no kissing part.

313
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:26,489
What's another famous
brother-sister team?

314
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:27,424
Uh, Hansel and Gretel?

315
00:12:27,448 --> 00:12:28,892
Yeah, right, those two were.

316
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,027
Dad, we need the belt.

317
00:12:30,051 --> 00:12:31,362
I can't go with you guys
watching.

318
00:12:31,386 --> 00:12:33,564
You're invisible.
What if the pee isn't?

319
00:12:33,588 --> 00:12:35,899
You know what?
We don't need invisibility.

320
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:37,634
Working together is our belt.

321
00:12:37,658 --> 00:12:38,902
That's our arc. Let's do it.

322
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:39,970
I'm gonna go ahead and whistle.

323
00:12:39,994 --> 00:12:41,727
That's how good I feel.

324
00:12:46,801 --> 00:12:49,035
Oh, God. I knew it.

325
00:12:50,872 --> 00:12:53,472
Ugh, this floor isn't level.

326
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:56,453
Are they gonna torture us?

327
00:12:56,477 --> 00:12:58,455
Unless you plan on
telling them what I know.

328
00:12:58,479 --> 00:13:00,657
Last chance to guess
who was the clone.

329
00:13:00,681 --> 00:13:01,792
You're his daughter.

330
00:13:01,816 --> 00:13:03,126
Just something about the eyes,

331
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,862
the shameless abandonment
of your family.

332
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:07,731
However can I live with myself?

333
00:13:07,755 --> 00:13:10,533
One theory... I was designed by
your father to live with myself,

334
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:12,135
which would mean you made
a conscious choice

335
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:14,738
to swallow your dreams with
cheap wine and dinosaur pasta.

336
00:13:14,762 --> 00:13:16,339
You know that's the kind
Jerry likes,

337
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:18,409
same way I know the only
Goddamn dream you'll ever follow

338
00:13:18,433 --> 00:13:20,143
is your shitty
father's approval.

339
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:22,079
You fetch your shitty
father's lemonade.

340
00:13:22,103 --> 00:13:24,147
You cosplay as your
shitty father in his 30s.

341
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:25,548
<i>Red alert. Red alert.</i>

342
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:27,751
<i>Rick Sanchez...</i>

343
00:13:27,775 --> 00:13:29,620
<i>More like dead alert.</i>
What else? What else?

344
00:13:29,644 --> 00:13:31,021
<i>I wrote some stuff down
in my Notes app.</i>

345
00:13:31,045 --> 00:13:32,890
<i>Let me just find it.</i>

346
00:13:32,914 --> 00:13:35,959
<i>Screw it. Beth, if... if one of
you is still alive,</i>

347
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:37,560
<i>you're my real daughter.</i>

348
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:39,096
<i>If you're both alive,
don't hurt the other one.</i>

349
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,764
<i>She's just a clone.
She's not worth it.</i>

350
00:13:40,788 --> 00:13:42,032
<i>I'm coming, baby.</i>

351
00:13:42,056 --> 00:13:44,235
- That piece of.
- That piece of.

352
00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:46,437
I came back kill him, you know.

353
00:13:46,461 --> 00:13:47,370
I'd like to help.

354
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:49,306
Kick me between my eyes.
From here?

355
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,907
Oh, you dropped yoga
so you could buy

356
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:52,931
Jerry more Flintstones Vitam...

357
00:13:56,671 --> 00:13:59,738
Oh, I do not like the looks
of this giant fight chamber.

358
00:14:06,281 --> 00:14:09,126
Bird Person?
It is now Phoenix Person.

359
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,527
You're working for them?

360
00:14:10,551 --> 00:14:11,929
What did they do to you, BP?

361
00:14:11,953 --> 00:14:14,197
It is now PP. Where is Tammy?

362
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:16,933
Oh, don't worry about her.
I killed her.

363
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:19,202
I loved her. Really? Huh.

364
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:20,937
Then can I suggest,
as an alternate name,

365
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:22,539
Crazy Whipped Person?

366
00:14:22,563 --> 00:14:23,940
Aah!

367
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:25,831
Unh!

368
00:14:29,704 --> 00:14:34,439
Aah!

369
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:40,157
It's funny. I always wondered
who would win if we ever fought.

370
00:14:40,181 --> 00:14:42,647
Then you were always
a bad friend.

371
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:46,785
Aah!

372
00:14:50,858 --> 00:14:52,102
Morty, we had one grenade.

373
00:14:52,126 --> 00:14:53,570
He had a gun. Whatever.

374
00:14:53,594 --> 00:14:55,506
Come on.

375
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,174
Did you hear something?
Doesn't matter.

376
00:14:57,198 --> 00:14:58,709
If anyone's around, they're here
to stop the laser,

377
00:14:58,733 --> 00:15:00,777
and they can't do it
without us seeing them.

378
00:15:00,801 --> 00:15:02,445
"Working together is our belt"?

379
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:04,381
You gave it away!
You said we didn't need it.

380
00:15:04,405 --> 00:15:05,649
I wish you were never born.

381
00:15:05,673 --> 00:15:06,939
You were an accident.

382
00:15:08,609 --> 00:15:10,053
How come some of
the pants are...

383
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:11,922
The NX-5 can't destroy
Wrangler jeans.

384
00:15:11,946 --> 00:15:15,659
Like, it literally can't destroy
them or it's programmed not to?

385
00:15:15,683 --> 00:15:17,149
Gee, what do you think?

386
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:51,762
You kill a good bug,
for a horse doctor.

387
00:15:51,786 --> 00:15:53,163
Thanks, me.

388
00:15:53,187 --> 00:15:54,565
Maybe we could do, like,
a "Parent Trap" thing

389
00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:55,832
together sometime.

390
00:15:55,856 --> 00:15:57,368
As long as you mean
the Lindsay Lohan version.

391
00:15:57,392 --> 00:15:58,591
Naturally.

392
00:16:00,661 --> 00:16:02,573
What do you think they do
with all those jeans?

393
00:16:02,597 --> 00:16:05,108
Make them into jackets?
It's not about conserving denim.

394
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:06,509
It's marketing. Like, uh,

395
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:08,245
"The NX-5 destroys
the whole planet

396
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:09,646
except for the Wrangler jeans."

397
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:12,449
Because they're so tough.
Tougher than the laser?

398
00:16:12,473 --> 00:16:14,317
Stupid. You're talking about it.

399
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:16,053
Mm, you're right.
They... they got me.

400
00:16:16,077 --> 00:16:17,388
Hey, over here. Look at me.

401
00:16:17,412 --> 00:16:19,189
Did you just see a pantsless
little boy run by?

402
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:20,591
I'm not falling for that again.

403
00:16:20,615 --> 00:16:22,325
I used to be invisible,
but now I'm the opposite.

404
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:23,660
Get him. But not in a weird way.

405
00:16:23,684 --> 00:16:25,017
You made it weird.

406
00:16:30,691 --> 00:16:33,270
<i>NX-5 corporate sponsor detected.</i>

407
00:16:33,294 --> 00:16:35,005
<i>Cannot penetrate Wranglers.</i>

408
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:36,273
<i>Built too tough.</i>

409
00:16:36,297 --> 00:16:39,098
<i>Built... too... tough.</i>

410
00:16:40,635 --> 00:16:42,479
I killed them!
I-I did... I did it offscreen.

411
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:43,880
God damn it.
Morty, fix your underwear.

412
00:16:43,904 --> 00:16:45,216
I saw your balls for a second.

413
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,417
That's on you.

414
00:16:46,441 --> 00:16:48,151
Why can't I meet your parents?

415
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:49,152
Are you embarrassed of me?

416
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:50,754
No, of them.

417
00:16:50,778 --> 00:16:51,778
Aww.

418
00:17:00,121 --> 00:17:02,655
Unh... ahh!

419
00:17:08,263 --> 00:17:10,373
Never thought this was
how I'd die.

420
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:11,574
We're nowhere near Venice,

421
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:13,332
and you're not a dwarf
in a raincoat.

422
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:18,582
Step back.
You're not killing him

423
00:17:18,606 --> 00:17:20,984
till we kick his ass,
Bird Person.

424
00:17:21,008 --> 00:17:22,920
My name is Phoenix Person.

425
00:17:22,944 --> 00:17:24,187
No one's calling you that. Dumb.

426
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:26,257
It fascinates me that
an entire family

427
00:17:26,281 --> 00:17:29,214
can be this critical
and suck this much.

428
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:44,007
Aah!

429
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:45,342
Bird Person, stop.

430
00:17:45,366 --> 00:17:47,744
It's me, that Tammy girl.

431
00:17:47,768 --> 00:17:50,147
Tammy, this is unexpected.

432
00:17:50,171 --> 00:17:51,482
I was told you were dead.

433
00:17:51,506 --> 00:17:54,551
That is ab-so-lute-ly not true.

434
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:57,620
I'm more alive than
I've ever been.

435
00:17:57,644 --> 00:18:00,023
You are behaving
rather strangely.

436
00:18:00,047 --> 00:18:02,293
Me? Strange? Oh, my.

437
00:18:02,317 --> 00:18:03,894
Well, who's normal, really?

438
00:18:03,918 --> 00:18:06,497
Now, come here, you big
hollow-boned featherhead.

439
00:18:06,521 --> 00:18:08,988
Let me give you
some of this sweet ass.

440
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,977
Saved the day with puppeting.

441
00:18:20,001 --> 00:18:21,312
Only one with a decent arc.

442
00:18:21,336 --> 00:18:22,913
He does have his moments.

443
00:18:22,937 --> 00:18:23,981
Mom, Dad!

444
00:18:24,005 --> 00:18:26,049
Mom. Uh, we did it!

445
00:18:26,073 --> 00:18:27,450
Morty became super visible!

446
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:29,252
Summer put my jeans in a laser!

447
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:31,454
Morty, look
at your little balls!

448
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:34,525
I know! Bring it in here, guys.

449
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:36,660
Damn, this thing has
twin turbines?

450
00:18:36,684 --> 00:18:39,262
I'll forgive you for abandoning
us if you let me drive it.

451
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:40,998
That works for me...
I was just gonna give you

452
00:18:41,022 --> 00:18:42,465
space cigarettes.
I love having two moms.

453
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:44,201
And I love having two wives.

454
00:18:44,225 --> 00:18:45,468
Never gonna happen, Jerry.

455
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:47,004
You jerk-offs ready to get
the answers

456
00:18:47,028 --> 00:18:48,605
to your burning questions?

457
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:50,741
What's this, Dad?
The memory of which Beth is real

458
00:18:50,765 --> 00:18:52,876
and which Beth is a clone,
obviously.

459
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,012
You mind-blew yourself? You...

460
00:18:55,036 --> 00:18:57,748
You literally don't even know
which of your daughters is real.

461
00:18:57,772 --> 00:18:59,482
Of course you don't.
Why am I surprised?

462
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:02,219
I'm sure you'd love for us
to need that from you,

463
00:19:02,243 --> 00:19:04,154
but I don't care
what's in that vial.

464
00:19:04,178 --> 00:19:05,356
Yeah, me neither.

465
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,890
You're a piece of either way.

466
00:19:06,914 --> 00:19:08,559
After all this, you don't want
to know the truth?

467
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,493
The truth is we have more
important to do

468
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:13,096
like raise our kids
and stamp out the Federation,

469
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,455
neither of which seem like they
want anything to do with you.

470
00:19:19,126 --> 00:19:21,238
Morty? Sum-Sum? You gotta at
least wanna know

471
00:19:21,262 --> 00:19:22,373
who your real mom is.

472
00:19:22,397 --> 00:19:23,374
Not really, Rick.

473
00:19:23,398 --> 00:19:24,575
We have two badass moms now.

474
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:26,176
It's...
That's kind of a win/win.

475
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,711
Yeah, Grandpa Rick, don't drag
us into your bull

476
00:19:27,735 --> 00:19:29,669
just because
you're losing control.

477
00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:36,319
I know what I want to do.

478
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:37,788
I want you to decide. What?

479
00:19:37,812 --> 00:19:40,323
For once in my life,
I want you to decide, Dad.

480
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:42,993
Do you want me to stay here
and be part of your life,

481
00:19:43,017 --> 00:19:44,950
or do you want me to leave?

482
00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:11,822
<i>Hup! Ho! Big money, big money.</i>

483
00:20:11,846 --> 00:20:14,091
<i>Eyes on the lady. Switcheroo.</i>

484
00:20:14,115 --> 00:20:16,248
<i>Which one's which?</i>

485
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:21,654
Holy shit.
I'm a terrible father.

486
00:20:25,192 --> 00:20:28,705
At least I'm a pretty
good friend.

487
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:32,397
Looks like it's just you
and me, buddy.

488
00:20:34,936 --> 00:20:37,202
Okay, alright, we'll give you
a little more time.

489
00:21:29,123 --> 00:21:31,302
Ah, goodbye, old friend.

490
00:21:31,326 --> 00:21:34,927
We've had our fun,
but I'm ready to be seen again.

491
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,377
- What the?!
- Oh, my God! Where did I go?

492
00:21:40,401 --> 00:21:42,379
Oh, shitskis.

493
00:21:42,403 --> 00:21:43,714
Aah!

494
00:21:43,738 --> 00:21:44,715
Slow down!

495
00:21:44,739 --> 00:21:46,249
There's an invisible
garbage truck

496
00:21:46,273 --> 00:21:48,608
in the road! Yeah, right.

497
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,478
I'm alive. I survi...

498
00:21:56,951 --> 00:21:59,952
I mean, when in Rome.

499
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:11,342
Bitch, your job is to have
intercourse with strangers

500
00:22:11,366 --> 00:22:12,743
and give me the money.

501
00:22:12,767 --> 00:22:14,477
Sorry I called you a bitch,
it's a vocational term.

502
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:16,347
It's not how I feel
about you personally.

503
00:22:16,371 --> 00:22:17,348
What the... what... what... aah!

504
00:22:17,372 --> 00:22:19,750
Aah!

505
00:22:19,774 --> 00:22:21,352
Somebody call for a pickup?

506
00:22:21,376 --> 00:22:23,576
Let's go take out the trash.

507
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:40,760
Well, we had a good run.

508
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,730
Did you get any of that?
