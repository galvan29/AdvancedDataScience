1
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:15,315
Hurry up, Morty.
Grandpa's about to un-freeze time.

2
00:00:15,317 --> 00:00:17,817
You really should be cleaning
from top to bottom.

3
00:00:17,819 --> 00:00:19,686
I know how to vacuum mom
and dad, Summer.

4
00:00:19,688 --> 00:00:21,154
I've been doing it
for six months.

5
00:00:21,156 --> 00:00:23,890
Then you've been doing
it wrong for six months.

6
00:00:23,892 --> 00:00:25,491
Oh, my God, is that mildew?

7
00:00:25,493 --> 00:00:27,827
It's not my fault we froze time
on a humid day.

8
00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:31,030
You have dropped
so many balls, man.

9
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:34,667
Do you ever get scared grandpa Rick
might make me his new sidekick?

10
00:00:34,669 --> 00:00:37,904
- What?! What kind of monster are you?
- A competent one.

11
00:00:37,906 --> 00:00:40,340
Who cares about the things
you guys are talking about?

12
00:00:40,342 --> 00:00:43,009
The whole point of freezing
time was to stop giving a [bleep].

13
00:00:43,011 --> 00:00:44,210
Put a shirt on your dumb dad,

14
00:00:44,212 --> 00:00:46,579
and let's get
this dumb universe rolling.

15
00:00:46,581 --> 00:00:48,248
Let's do this thing.

16
00:00:51,586 --> 00:00:52,885
All right, listen, you two.

17
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:55,955
We froze time for a pretty long
time, so when I un-freeze it,

18
00:00:55,957 --> 00:00:57,357
the world's time
is gonna be fine,

19
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:00,793
but our time's gonna need a little
time to, you know, stabilize.

20
00:01:00,795 --> 00:01:03,363
Our time is gonna be unstable?
What does that even mean?

21
00:01:03,365 --> 00:01:05,698
It means relax
and stop being a pussy, Morty.

22
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,700
Uh, I thought
you learned that by now.

23
00:01:07,702 --> 00:01:09,202
It also means
don't touch your parents,

24
00:01:09,204 --> 00:01:11,104
or we could shatter into
countless theoretical shards.

25
00:01:11,106 --> 00:01:13,539
- Wait a minute, what?
- And away we go!

26
00:01:14,743 --> 00:01:18,544
♪♪

27
00:01:18,546 --> 00:01:21,147
Um... did we ever put
that mattress under Mr. Benson?

28
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:22,448
- Shhh.
- Shush, Morty.

29
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,817
A thing or two about...
Wait, what?

30
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:26,653
Was the house...
When we pulled up,

31
00:01:26,655 --> 00:01:29,756
I could have sworn the house
was completely trashed.

32
00:01:29,758 --> 00:01:31,124
Negative visualization, Jerry.

33
00:01:31,126 --> 00:01:32,925
Explains a lot
about where you're at.

34
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:34,894
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi, dad.

35
00:01:34,896 --> 00:01:36,829
Summer, Morty, are you okay?

36
00:01:36,831 --> 00:01:40,266
- We... we just missed you a lot.
- Yeah, we missed you so much.

37
00:01:40,268 --> 00:01:41,968
Too much to hug you, though.

38
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,469
Yeah, it would
literally destroy them.

39
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:45,305
Now, listen, why don't...
Why don't...

40
00:01:45,307 --> 00:01:47,173
Why don't you guys go
get a free Sunday ice cream?

41
00:01:47,175 --> 00:01:48,741
Get out there
and get some ice creams.

42
00:01:48,743 --> 00:01:51,110
Here's $500 cash
in unmarked monies.

43
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:54,447
I'm just gonna put it on the
floor and kick it on over to ya.

44
00:01:54,449 --> 00:01:56,582
- You guys go nuts.
- This better not be a bribe.

45
00:01:56,584 --> 00:01:59,819
If I find a single thing
out of place in this house,

46
00:01:59,821 --> 00:02:02,088
my love of ice cream
won't save you.

47
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,656
I'll get my jacket.

48
00:02:03,658 --> 00:02:06,593
Sweetie, is your shirt
on backwards?

49
00:02:08,797 --> 00:02:11,431
Yeah.
I like it this way.

50
00:02:11,433 --> 00:02:12,665
I'm not stupid.

51
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:13,933
- Phew!
- Oh.

52
00:02:13,935 --> 00:02:15,802
Man, that guy
is the Redgren Grumbholdt

53
00:02:15,804 --> 00:02:17,704
of pretending he knows
what's going on.

54
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,206
- Oh, you agree, huh?
- It's funny.

55
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:21,607
You like that Redgren Grumbholdt
reference?

56
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:23,476
- Yeah.
- Well, guess what? I made him up.

57
00:02:23,478 --> 00:02:25,278
You really are
your father's children.

58
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,281
Think for yourselves.
Don't be sheep.

God, I feel terrible.

61
00:03:06,321 --> 00:03:09,322
Yep, it really makes you appreciate
how fickle the universe can be.

62
00:03:09,324 --> 00:03:11,891
One minute you're falling
off a roof for six months,

63
00:03:11,893 --> 00:03:13,259
the next minute, bam!

64
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:15,161
Uh, just to be clear,
it was Summer's job

65
00:03:15,163 --> 00:03:16,396
to put the mattress under...

66
00:03:16,398 --> 00:03:18,030
Uh, what?
It was your job, Morty.

67
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:19,432
- Nuh-uh!
- Yuh-huh!

68
00:03:19,434 --> 00:03:20,500
Actually, sorry, Summer.

69
00:03:20,502 --> 00:03:22,101
I got to back the "m" bomb
on this one.

70
00:03:22,103 --> 00:03:23,603
I remember the conversation.

71
00:03:23,605 --> 00:03:26,005
We told Morty to replace all
the bank's money with cookies.

72
00:03:26,007 --> 00:03:28,107
Your job was to put the mattress
under Mr. Benson.

73
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:30,009
Boom!
In your face, Summer!

74
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:32,178
You really dropped
the ball, man.

75
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,247
Shut up, Morty,
you vindictive little turd!

76
00:03:34,249 --> 00:03:37,049
You shut up,
you big female asshole!

77
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:38,751
Hey, don't shove me!

78
00:03:38,753 --> 00:03:40,019
- I didn't!
- You didn't what?

79
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:41,687
- What's your problem?
- What's yours?

80
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:42,789
- Shut up!
- You shut up!

81
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,190
Wh-whoa, whoa!

82
00:03:44,192 --> 00:03:46,392
What the hell, hell,
hell, hell, hell?

83
00:03:46,394 --> 00:03:49,028
Oh, God. Oh, no.
What did you guys just do?

84
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,530
- What did who do?
- What do you mean?

85
00:03:50,532 --> 00:03:52,465
- Wait, what am I saying?
- Were either

86
00:03:52,467 --> 00:03:54,434
of you guys uncertain
about anything just now?

87
00:03:54,436 --> 00:03:55,868
Oh, man, I don't feel good.

88
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,270
- Am I me?
- Am I talking right now?

89
00:03:57,272 --> 00:03:58,905
- I think so.
- Wait, who said that?

90
00:03:58,907 --> 00:04:00,473
All right,
both of you just don't move.

91
00:04:00,475 --> 00:04:02,642
Don't speak, don't think.
I have to check something.

92
00:04:02,644 --> 00:04:04,777
- What'd you do, Morty?
- I'm gonna help grandpa.

93
00:04:04,779 --> 00:04:07,213
What do you mean
<i>you're</i> gonna help him?

94
00:04:07,215 --> 00:04:08,748
I can help, too.

95
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,716
- What's happening, grandpa?
- What's going on, Rick?

96
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:12,385
Sh-sh-shut up.

97
00:04:12,387 --> 00:04:14,720
Oh, crap, are you kidding me?
Two dots?

98
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:16,422
This never needs to be
more than one dot.

99
00:04:16,424 --> 00:04:18,057
The two of you made us
uncertain!

100
00:04:18,059 --> 00:04:19,826
- What are you talking about?
- What's that mean?

101
00:04:19,828 --> 00:04:21,227
- English, please.
- English?

102
00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:22,762
Our time is fractured...
You two somehow created

103
00:04:22,764 --> 00:04:24,931
a feedback look of uncertainty
that split our reality

104
00:04:24,933 --> 00:04:27,400
into two equally possible
impossibilities.

105
00:04:27,402 --> 00:04:29,735
W-we're exactly like a man
capable of sustaining

106
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:32,738
a platonic friendship with
an attractive female co-worker.

107
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,173
We're entirely hypothetical.

108
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,843
But I thought there were
infinite time lines?

109
00:04:36,845 --> 00:04:38,911
We're not on any
time line, dummy.

110
00:04:38,913 --> 00:04:41,013
Look.

111
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:42,281
Oh, my God!

112
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:43,483
Are those cats?

113
00:04:43,485 --> 00:04:45,818
I assume they're
Schrödinger's cats.

114
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,754
Or, actually, I assume they both
are and aren't, just like us.

115
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:50,456
- Is the world gone?
- Is the world gone?

116
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,124
- Where are mom and dad?
- What about mom and dad?

117
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:54,460
Mom and dad? Get your head
out of your family's ass.

118
00:04:54,462 --> 00:04:56,863
The three of us are lost
in a timeless oblivion.

119
00:04:56,865 --> 00:04:58,331
Your parents get to exist.

120
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,433
They're probably living it up
in some pointless,

121
00:05:00,435 --> 00:05:02,635
grounded story
about their [bleep] marriage.

122
00:05:02,637 --> 00:05:04,604
Cold stone creamery
is the best.

123
00:05:04,606 --> 00:05:07,607
What should we do
with our remaining $20?

124
00:05:07,609 --> 00:05:10,676
You realize they sing
no matter how much you tip?

125
00:05:10,678 --> 00:05:12,545
- Whoa!
- Aaah!

126
00:05:12,547 --> 00:05:13,546
Holy [bleep]!

127
00:05:13,548 --> 00:05:15,448
- What happened?
- I hit a deer.

128
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,517
We... we have to tell
the cops you were driving.

129
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:20,219
- What?
- This is rum raisin!

130
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,512
- It's still alive.
- Well, do we...

131
00:05:24,537 --> 00:05:27,460
Do I, uh, get, uh,
a big rock, or...?

132
00:05:27,462 --> 00:05:29,161
It's not an armadillo, asshole.

133
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:31,030
I thought that's what
a man's supposed to say.

134
00:05:31,032 --> 00:05:32,565
It's not like
I could've actually done it.

135
00:05:32,567 --> 00:05:34,534
If we were near a hospital,
I could treat it,

136
00:05:34,536 --> 00:05:36,235
but I...
I think we have to just...

137
00:05:36,237 --> 00:05:38,671
It's okay. This is
just something that happens.

138
00:05:38,673 --> 00:05:41,474
And even if we were
in a hospital, what could we do?

139
00:05:41,476 --> 00:05:43,976
You're a horse surgeon,
not a deer surgeon.

140
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:45,144
So...?

141
00:05:45,146 --> 00:05:46,479
Well, don't different animals...

142
00:05:46,481 --> 00:05:48,214
Require different levels
of skill to keep alive?

143
00:05:48,216 --> 00:05:50,082
- Oh, God.
- Get the deer in the car, Jerry.

144
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:51,317
Yes, Beth.

145
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:53,319
This is why you
don't freeze time, you guys.

146
00:05:53,321 --> 00:05:54,754
It's incredibly irresponsible.

147
00:05:54,756 --> 00:05:57,223
And you did it so we could clean
the house after a party?

148
00:05:57,225 --> 00:05:59,659
Look, there's no time
to hold me accountable, Morty.

149
00:05:59,661 --> 00:06:01,527
Like, literally no time.
Look around.

150
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:04,063
Uncertainty
is inherently unsustainable.

151
00:06:04,065 --> 00:06:06,332
Eventually, everything either is
or isn't.

152
00:06:06,334 --> 00:06:08,834
And we've got about four hours
to be "is".

153
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:10,736
- Or...?
- We isn't.

154
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:13,539
All right, since this time crystal
exists in both possibilities,

155
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:16,008
and since it's impossible
that I didn't nail this,

156
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,710
I'm probably about
to press this button

157
00:06:17,712 --> 00:06:20,079
in both possibilities
at exactly the same time.

158
00:06:20,081 --> 00:06:21,514
- How do you know...
- How do you know that...

159
00:06:21,516 --> 00:06:23,516
Whatever your asking me,
the answer is I'm amazing.

160
00:06:23,518 --> 00:06:25,518
And away we go.

161
00:06:28,423 --> 00:06:31,057
Huh, what do you know.
It's working.

162
00:06:31,059 --> 00:06:33,559
- Ow, ow, ow!
- Oh [bleep].

163
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:35,928
What the hell
is wrong with you two?

164
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,196
I-I-I-I mean you four!

165
00:06:37,198 --> 00:06:38,931
That hurt!
That was painful.

166
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:41,200
Good, I'm glad it was painful.
You deserve it.

167
00:06:41,202 --> 00:06:43,769
I saw you. Y-you're both
all over the damn place.

168
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:45,938
We've been split for 20 minutes
and your lives

169
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,474
are already scattered
to the quantum [bleep] wind?

170
00:06:48,476 --> 00:06:49,976
What the hell do either
of you two

171
00:06:49,978 --> 00:06:52,545
have to be so uncertain about?
Your brand of zit cream?

172
00:06:52,547 --> 00:06:54,547
Which chair to sit in
while I do everything?

173
00:06:54,549 --> 00:06:56,515
- Come on, spit it out!
- Well, you don't exactly make it easy, Rick.

174
00:06:56,517 --> 00:06:58,484
You make fun of me all the time...
You're always picking on me...

175
00:06:58,486 --> 00:07:00,820
And now Summer's doing it... and
now you got Summer to kiss your ass.

176
00:07:00,822 --> 00:07:03,222
Me?! What about you? You're just as
mean to me because you're jealous...

177
00:07:03,224 --> 00:07:04,319
Could you get more
excited to see me fail?

178
00:07:04,344 --> 00:07:05,491
Because you want
grandpa all to yourself!

179
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:08,160
All right, all right, cool it.
I see what's happening here.

180
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:09,895
You're both young,
you're both unsure

181
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:11,230
about your place
in the universe,

182
00:07:11,232 --> 00:07:13,099
and you both want
to be grandpa's favorite.

183
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:14,734
I can fix this.
Morty, sit here.

184
00:07:14,736 --> 00:07:16,502
Summer, you sit here.
Now, listen.

185
00:07:16,504 --> 00:07:18,170
I know the two of you
are very different

186
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:19,438
from each other
in a lot of ways,

187
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,408
but you have to understand that
as far as grandpa's concerned,

188
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,110
you're both pieces of shit.
Yeah.

189
00:07:24,112 --> 00:07:25,444
I can prove it mathematically.

190
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:27,179
Actually, let me
grab my white board.

191
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:28,914
This has been
a long time coming, anyway.

192
00:07:30,652 --> 00:07:32,585
Emergency!
Wounded deer coming in.

193
00:07:32,587 --> 00:07:34,253
Three.

194
00:07:34,255 --> 00:07:36,088
Excuse me,
you can't be back here.

195
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,590
I'm a certified horse surgeon,

196
00:07:37,592 --> 00:07:39,525
and this deer
needs medical attention.

197
00:07:39,527 --> 00:07:41,861
- Nurse, please move that snake.
- That's <i>my</i> nurse.

198
00:07:41,863 --> 00:07:43,829
And as a horse surgeon,
I'm sure that you know

199
00:07:43,831 --> 00:07:47,199
that deer have much smaller,
much more intricate organs.

200
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:49,268
As a vet, I'm sure you know
that a deer

201
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,604
is closer to a horse
than you are to a doctor.

202
00:07:51,606 --> 00:07:54,273
So let's save the measuring
for when our dicks are out.

203
00:07:54,275 --> 00:07:55,975
- It's time to save a life!
- Geez.

204
00:07:57,445 --> 00:07:59,879
That's odd.
This deer's wounded.

205
00:07:59,881 --> 00:08:02,281
Uh, yeah, I was there.
You don't have to rub it in.

206
00:08:02,283 --> 00:08:04,650
I mean it's been shot
with a gun.

207
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:06,786
My gun.

208
00:08:06,788 --> 00:08:08,387
May I help <i>you,</i> sir?

209
00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:10,322
No, but you can stop
helping this deer.

210
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:12,558
I shot it before these two
hit it with their car,

211
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,660
and I followed them
when they hauled it off.

212
00:08:14,662 --> 00:08:16,295
This deer belongs to me.

213
00:08:16,297 --> 00:08:18,297
We don't have time
for this, okay?

214
00:08:18,299 --> 00:08:20,166
I need anaesthetic
and deer saline.

215
00:08:20,168 --> 00:08:22,134
Look, I don't know what
the law says about this,

216
00:08:22,136 --> 00:08:24,804
but I took an oath that I would
let no animal come to harm.

217
00:08:24,806 --> 00:08:27,339
Except when sterilizing,
aborting, or euthanizing them,

218
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:29,308
or also when eating them
at also any meal.

219
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,843
I'm calling my lawyer.

220
00:08:30,845 --> 00:08:33,679
I hope for all our sakes you're as
bad a surgeon as I am a hunter.

221
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:35,648
In your dreams, bitch.
Scalpel.

222
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:39,051
So, in conclusion,
you're both equally mercurial,

223
00:08:39,053 --> 00:08:42,988
overly sensitive, clingy,
hysterical, bird-brained homunculi.

224
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:46,092
And I honestly can't even tell the
two of you apart half the time

225
00:08:46,094 --> 00:08:47,660
because I don't go
by height or age,

226
00:08:47,662 --> 00:08:50,529
I go by amount of pain in my ass,
which makes you both identical.

227
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:52,164
All right, everything resolved?

228
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,433
Everybody nice and certain about
their position in my world.

229
00:08:54,435 --> 00:08:55,735
- Yes.
- Yes.

230
00:08:55,737 --> 00:08:57,336
All right, perfect.
Sit still.

231
00:08:57,338 --> 00:08:59,271
Arms down.
I'm gonna do this again.

232
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:01,273
This time be like grandpa.

233
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:02,441
You mean drunk?

234
00:09:02,443 --> 00:09:04,243
What's that?
You got something to say?

235
00:09:04,245 --> 00:09:05,344
- No.
- And away we go!

236
00:09:05,346 --> 00:09:07,947
And away we go!

237
00:09:07,949 --> 00:09:10,850
- Huh, that's weird.
- Huh, that's weird.

238
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,119
- Oh, my God.
- What?

239
00:09:13,121 --> 00:09:14,620
- Oh, my God.
- What?

240
00:09:14,622 --> 00:09:16,122
- The son of a bitch is gonna kill me!
- What?!

241
00:09:16,124 --> 00:09:18,090
- The son of a bitch is gonna kill me!
- What?!

242
00:09:18,092 --> 00:09:19,425
Diabolical, unfeeling sociopath.

243
00:09:19,427 --> 00:09:20,926
- Don't you get it?!
- Don't you get it?!

244
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:23,129
The other Rick isn't trying
to merge us anymore.

245
00:09:23,131 --> 00:09:25,931
He thinks he can save his own skin
by using the crystal to kill me.

246
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:27,867
He probably figures
it's easier

247
00:09:27,869 --> 00:09:30,302
to eliminate one of the possibilities
rather than merge them.

248
00:09:30,304 --> 00:09:31,537
I have to admit,

249
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:33,372
it was always in the back
of my mind, too.

250
00:09:33,374 --> 00:09:35,307
The difference is
I would never do it, until now.

251
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:37,710
- Rick, what the hell are you doing?
- Saving our lives!

252
00:09:37,712 --> 00:09:40,379
After he takes me out, he's...
He's gonna be coming for you.

253
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:41,580
- Who?
- Me!

254
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:42,715
Aah!

255
00:09:42,717 --> 00:09:44,416
- Whoa!
- You see that? Get down!

256
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:46,485
I told you, he's a psycho.
He's lost it!

257
00:09:46,487 --> 00:09:48,587
Th-th-th-the time fracture
must have made him crazy!

258
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:50,256
- I don't know what to do!
- Oh, crap!

259
00:09:50,258 --> 00:09:51,957
I don't know what to do!

260
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:55,261
Oh, God,
now there's three of them.

261
00:09:55,263 --> 00:09:57,229
We're outnumbered.
Get in the cupboards.

262
00:09:57,231 --> 00:09:58,430
Wait, don't...
don't do that.

263
00:09:58,432 --> 00:09:59,932
They'll know.
Wait, wait.

264
00:09:59,934 --> 00:10:02,168
Think about getting in
the cupboards, but don't really.

265
00:10:03,938 --> 00:10:06,238
Is this what you want,
you sick [bleep]?!

266
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,807
You want to see children die?!

267
00:10:07,809 --> 00:10:08,908
You son of a bitch.

268
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,410
You don't stop living
until I say so!

269
00:10:11,412 --> 00:10:12,444
Michael.

270
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:13,913
- Who's this now?
- My lawyer.

271
00:10:13,915 --> 00:10:16,415
I'm here to notify you, ma'am,
that in this county,

272
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:17,983
any deer shot by a hunter

273
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:20,319
is that hunter's property
regardless of how far it runs

274
00:10:20,321 --> 00:10:22,188
or who intercepts it
before it dies.

275
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,455
It's called Brad's law.

276
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:24,924
We can't make you
stop the surgery,

277
00:10:24,926 --> 00:10:27,326
but at this point,
you're performing it on venison.

278
00:10:27,328 --> 00:10:29,662
Actually,
I've decided not to eat it.

279
00:10:29,664 --> 00:10:33,165
All this fear and conflict...
I'm sure it's ruined the meat.

280
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:35,601
I'm just gonna use the head
for my rec-room wall.

281
00:10:35,603 --> 00:10:37,102
She normally works on horses.

282
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:40,172
Jerry, if you're not gonna help,
get the [bleep] out of here.

283
00:10:40,174 --> 00:10:44,109
I will reach into heaven and yank
your screaming deer soul back!

284
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:45,945
Jesus.

285
00:10:45,947 --> 00:10:47,213
Shh, shh!

286
00:10:47,215 --> 00:10:49,114
I know where you are,
you creepy old monster.

287
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:50,449
I know how you think.

288
00:10:50,451 --> 00:10:52,451
Oh, is there where
you think I'm going?

289
00:10:52,453 --> 00:10:53,986
You think I'm standing here?

290
00:10:53,988 --> 00:10:55,221
Well, maybe you're right.

291
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:58,157
Holy [bleep] now what?

292
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:00,192
Well, if all of me
knocked out all the Ricks,

293
00:11:00,194 --> 00:11:01,560
and you peed
in all of your pants,

294
00:11:01,562 --> 00:11:03,462
doesn't that mean
that we're all synchronized?

295
00:11:03,464 --> 00:11:04,964
- Right.
- Okay.

296
00:11:04,966 --> 00:11:07,633
So, from now on, whatever we do,
we have to be certain.

297
00:11:07,635 --> 00:11:08,868
Right.

298
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,737
I think I'm certain
we're effed in the "a".

299
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:15,842
Oh, God, my head.

300
00:11:15,844 --> 00:11:17,377
What did you guys do?

301
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:20,513
We put you in a dog crate
because you were acting crazy

302
00:11:20,515 --> 00:11:22,582
and you caused
another time fracture.

303
00:11:22,584 --> 00:11:23,784
You tried to kill yourself.

304
00:11:23,785 --> 00:11:25,018
O-only in self-defense.

305
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,419
Myself tried to kill me first.

306
00:11:26,421 --> 00:11:28,688
Guys, I don't expect you
to understand this,

307
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,523
but time breaking twice
means our problem is

308
00:11:30,525 --> 00:11:33,293
two times bigger and we've got
half as much time to solve it.

309
00:11:33,295 --> 00:11:35,595
Well, actually, I do expect you
to understand that.

310
00:11:35,597 --> 00:11:38,064
It's basic math. C-can somebody
just let me out of here?

311
00:11:38,066 --> 00:11:39,699
If I die in a cage,
I lose a bet.

312
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:41,234
Well, is there some way
you can prove

313
00:11:41,236 --> 00:11:43,136
you're not a threat to yourself
and others anymore?

314
00:11:43,138 --> 00:11:44,871
Oh, for God's sake.
All right, here.

315
00:11:44,873 --> 00:11:46,940
- Give me the time crystal.
- Wh-what are you doing?

316
00:11:46,942 --> 00:11:49,109
Calling myself.
Here, listen.

317
00:11:49,111 --> 00:11:50,677
It'll probably go
to voice-mail

318
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:52,145
since, you know,
I'm calling myself.

319
00:11:52,147 --> 00:11:55,282
<i>- Hello, Rick here.</i>
- Don't fall for it. It's a bit.

320
00:11:55,284 --> 00:11:58,151
<i>Just kidding! Ha, ha!
You just got ricked.</i>

321
00:11:58,153 --> 00:12:00,121
<i>- You've reached Rick's voice-mail.
- You know what to do.</i>

322
00:12:00,223 --> 00:12:01,789
Hey, Rick. It's Rick.

323
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,491
Listen, I'm sorry about earlier.
No hard feelings.

324
00:12:03,493 --> 00:12:05,493
I know you know I mean it, too.
Take it easy.

325
00:12:05,895 --> 00:12:07,328
Whoa, damn! Look at this.

326
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,663
I'm blowing up...
Three new voicemails.

327
00:12:10,565 --> 00:12:11,764
<i>Hey, Rick. It's Rick.</i>

328
00:12:11,766 --> 00:12:13,066
<i>Listen, I'm sorry about earlier.</i>

329
00:12:13,068 --> 00:12:14,667
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I heard this one.

330
00:12:14,669 --> 00:12:16,002
<i>Hey, Rick. It's Rick.</i>

331
00:12:16,004 --> 00:12:17,504
<i>Hey, Rick, it's...</i>
You get the idea.

332
00:12:17,506 --> 00:12:19,139
W-we're cool now.

333
00:12:19,141 --> 00:12:20,974
Okay, well, we're still not
gonna let you out of this crate.

334
00:12:20,976 --> 00:12:22,408
Fine. I'll just do it myself.

335
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,844
If you could get out that whole
time, why didn't you?

336
00:12:24,846 --> 00:12:26,646
Because I waited
until I was certain

337
00:12:26,648 --> 00:12:28,148
it was what I wanted
to do, Morty.

338
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,083
That's the difference
between you and me.

339
00:12:30,085 --> 00:12:31,317
I'm certain, and you're

340
00:12:31,319 --> 00:12:33,820
a walking burlap sack filled
with turds.

341
00:12:33,822 --> 00:12:35,155
You know, geez, Rick!

342
00:12:35,157 --> 00:12:36,789
Y-y-you're really tearing
into me right now.

343
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:38,358
You know, words hurt.

344
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,659
- Holy!
- A monster!

345
00:12:39,661 --> 00:12:41,594
Hey, you... hey, quit yelling.

346
00:12:41,596 --> 00:12:43,830
Quit yelling.
What the [bleep]

347
00:12:43,832 --> 00:12:45,665
Your time is all ripped up
to hell!

348
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:47,667
You broke your time twice.

349
00:12:47,669 --> 00:12:49,669
How did this happen?

350
00:12:51,173 --> 00:12:53,706
Shut the [bleep] up.
Oh, damn.

351
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,475
I'm from the fourth dimension.

352
00:12:55,477 --> 00:12:56,843
I can hear all of y'all.

353
00:12:56,845 --> 00:12:59,045
Now let's just see what we got
here for a second.

354
00:12:59,047 --> 00:13:00,848
Hey, damn it.

355
00:13:00,849 --> 00:13:02,882
Were you trying
to use this to...

356
00:13:02,884 --> 00:13:05,852
Oh, see, you broke time,
and you thought you could

357
00:13:05,854 --> 00:13:07,854
just stick it back together
with this?

358
00:13:07,856 --> 00:13:09,489
How you think
you gonna move time

359
00:13:09,491 --> 00:13:10,890
while you're standing in it,

360
00:13:10,892 --> 00:13:12,692
you dumb-ass three-dimensional
monkey-ass dummies?

361
00:13:12,694 --> 00:13:13,960
Oh, way to go, Rick.

362
00:13:13,962 --> 00:13:15,328
Yeah, grandpa, way to go.

363
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,197
What, you're just gonna listen
to this guy now?

364
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:19,399
He's got a giant testicle
for a head.

365
00:13:19,401 --> 00:13:20,667
He came here in a bubble.

366
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:24,070
For all we know, he could be the
David Berkowitz of nutsackland.

367
00:13:24,072 --> 00:13:26,239
Shut up.
Here, put these on.

368
00:13:26,241 --> 00:13:28,074
They'll sync
your possibilities up

369
00:13:28,076 --> 00:13:30,143
so I can bring you back
to certain time.

370
00:13:30,145 --> 00:13:32,312
Y'all are just...
Just... just negligent.

371
00:13:32,314 --> 00:13:34,147
See, now...
Now look right here.

372
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:36,049
Hey, hey, hey, the three of you,
put your collars on.

373
00:13:36,051 --> 00:13:37,750
- We have them on.
- What are you talking about?

374
00:13:37,752 --> 00:13:39,152
- Uh, we did.
- We're not wearing collars.

375
00:13:39,154 --> 00:13:40,987
Exactly.
'Cause you're being obstinate.

376
00:13:40,989 --> 00:13:42,388
What?

377
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,357
Put the damn collars on
if you want to live.

378
00:13:44,359 --> 00:13:46,326
- They're on right now.
- We did. They're on.

379
00:13:46,328 --> 00:13:48,494
All right, fine.
Summer, Morty, put them on.

380
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,032
- Yes, we're back!
- No more cats!

381
00:13:53,034 --> 00:13:54,901
- We're back in certain time.
- Problem solved.

382
00:13:54,903 --> 00:13:56,169
No more cats!
Oh, you did it!

383
00:13:56,171 --> 00:13:58,104
- You fixed it.
- Yeah, I did.

384
00:13:58,106 --> 00:13:59,706
Now keep those
collars on so you

385
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,241
don't break
your weak-ass time again.

386
00:14:01,243 --> 00:14:03,276
How long, exactly, do we have
to wear these things?

387
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:04,744
They're really embarrassing.

388
00:14:04,746 --> 00:14:07,013
Well, since you're going
to time prison,

389
00:14:07,015 --> 00:14:09,115
I'd say you can
keep them on forever.

390
00:14:09,117 --> 00:14:11,050
- Time prison?
- Yeah.

391
00:14:11,052 --> 00:14:13,052
Well, I don't know where you
expect me to think

392
00:14:13,054 --> 00:14:14,420
you got
that crystal over there,

393
00:14:14,422 --> 00:14:18,358
but the only way your dumb-ass
assin' ass asses

394
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,227
could ever have on
is if it was stolen.

395
00:14:21,229 --> 00:14:23,763
You stole a time-freezing
crystal from testicle monsters?!

396
00:14:23,765 --> 00:14:26,432
I would've been happy to pay
for it, s... Summer,

397
00:14:26,434 --> 00:14:28,468
but they don't exactly sell them
at Costco.

398
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:31,304
Besides, there's a larger lesson
to be learned here. Get him!

399
00:14:31,306 --> 00:14:32,939
No, no, no, no!
You better keep back!

400
00:14:32,941 --> 00:14:34,407
Man, this will turn your ass

401
00:14:34,409 --> 00:14:36,743
into a third-trimester fetus
from 30 yards.

402
00:14:39,247 --> 00:14:40,647
Mm.

403
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:43,283
Isn't there a kitten somewhere
that needs a manicure?

404
00:14:43,285 --> 00:14:45,785
That's right, Mrs. Smith.
Give in to your anger.

405
00:14:45,787 --> 00:14:47,920
Neglect that deer.

406
00:14:47,922 --> 00:14:49,822
Honey, it's gonna be okay.

407
00:14:49,824 --> 00:14:51,791
These men are
from the Cervine Institute

408
00:14:51,793 --> 00:14:53,293
of elk, moose, deer, and stag.

409
00:14:53,295 --> 00:14:55,295
They can take this deer
to a helicopter

410
00:14:55,297 --> 00:14:57,430
and fly it to the country's
top deer surgeon

411
00:14:57,432 --> 00:14:59,799
on a wildlife reserve
across the state border.

412
00:14:59,801 --> 00:15:02,335
Where your jurisdiction ends.

413
00:15:03,805 --> 00:15:05,738
I guess that's the end of that.

414
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,307
There is just one more thing.

415
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:09,942
According to this state's
veterinarian statute,

416
00:15:09,944 --> 00:15:11,811
this animal
can't be transferred

417
00:15:11,813 --> 00:15:13,913
until the current
attending physician

418
00:15:13,915 --> 00:15:18,284
verbally confirms their inability
to provide adequate care.

419
00:15:18,286 --> 00:15:20,486
You heard the man,
horse doctor.

420
00:15:20,488 --> 00:15:24,324
You have to say
you couldn't hack it.

421
00:15:24,326 --> 00:15:26,993
We did it!

422
00:15:26,995 --> 00:15:28,928
Uh-huh. No, mother... no.
Earth, dude.

423
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,264
No, I'm talking about...
Yeah, with the dinosaurs.

424
00:15:31,266 --> 00:15:33,933
No, if you get to the dolphin
people, you gone too far.

425
00:15:33,935 --> 00:15:36,102
All right, man,
I'll talk to you later. Okay.

426
00:15:36,104 --> 00:15:37,503
You know what they do

427
00:15:37,505 --> 00:15:39,439
to third-dimensional life forms
in time prison?

428
00:15:39,441 --> 00:15:41,808
Same thing they do in every
other prison, only forever.

429
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,176
Why are you doing this?

430
00:15:43,178 --> 00:15:45,345
You think I want to be
an omniscient immortal being

431
00:15:45,347 --> 00:15:47,513
transcending time and space
my whole life?

432
00:15:47,515 --> 00:15:48,548
I got ambitions, man.

433
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,450
Bringing you guys in
is my ticket up.

434
00:15:50,452 --> 00:15:54,854
What if I told you there's a
huge ticket up right behind you?

435
00:15:54,856 --> 00:15:57,690
- You really think I'm that stupid?
- All right, hear me out on this.

436
00:15:57,692 --> 00:15:59,559
You're immortal, right, which
means your life is infinite.

437
00:15:59,561 --> 00:16:01,561
Okay, well, then that means
there's a 100% chance

438
00:16:01,563 --> 00:16:03,196
that you'll
eventually do everything,

439
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:05,698
including turning around
to look behind you.

440
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,866
I cannot argue that.

441
00:16:06,868 --> 00:16:08,469
Aaah!

442
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,970
Oh, God, gross and weird!

443
00:16:10,972 --> 00:16:13,139
Chris!

444
00:16:13,141 --> 00:16:14,507
You killed my gun!

445
00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:16,142
Summer, Morty,
take off your collars.

446
00:16:16,144 --> 00:16:17,643
- What?
- What the hell are you doing?

447
00:16:17,645 --> 00:16:22,248
Good question. I suppose
the answer is I'm not certain.

448
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,883
Oh, no, what are you doing?

449
00:16:23,885 --> 00:16:25,651
- I have no idea.
- I'm not sure.

450
00:16:25,653 --> 00:16:27,086
Stop it!

451
00:16:27,088 --> 00:16:29,555
Maybe I will, maybe I won't.

452
00:16:29,557 --> 00:16:31,858
I'm really uncertain
about everything,

453
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,159
even kicking your ass.

454
00:16:33,161 --> 00:16:34,527
List... hey!
Tw... ow!

455
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:36,562
But these arms are vestigial!

456
00:16:36,564 --> 00:16:38,564
Now, you poked me where
an eye would've been

457
00:16:38,566 --> 00:16:40,166
about 6 million years ago.

458
00:16:40,168 --> 00:16:42,168
Come on, let's help grandpa.

459
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:44,604
Yes! I'm 100%
not sure about anything!

460
00:16:44,606 --> 00:16:46,339
Yeah, totally uncertain.

461
00:16:46,341 --> 00:16:48,174
Beat his ass!
Get him! Beat him up!

462
00:16:48,176 --> 00:16:50,610
- Kick his ass, Rick!
- Die, mother[bleep]!

463
00:16:50,612 --> 00:16:52,011
Ow! I'm defeated.

464
00:16:52,013 --> 00:16:54,013
- What's happening?
- Time is falling apart.

465
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,548
We've got to get back
to certainty quick.

466
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,883
Give me your collars.

467
00:16:56,885 --> 00:16:58,918
Oh, man. Don't you have to fix,
like, 30 of them?

468
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,286
Morty, I have to fix three
of them.

469
00:17:00,288 --> 00:17:01,854
And then there's 31
other versions of me

470
00:17:01,856 --> 00:17:04,524
that have to also fix three,
for a total of 96.

471
00:17:04,526 --> 00:17:06,926
I'm not an idiot.
I know how to be decisive.

472
00:17:06,928 --> 00:17:08,861
- Now hand me that flat-head screwdriver.
- Now hand me that Phillips screwdriver.

473
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,930
- Actually, make it a flat-head.
- Actually, make it a Phillips.

474
00:17:10,932 --> 00:17:12,532
Oh, shit.

475
00:17:12,534 --> 00:17:15,968
Look, I know I was
kind of a nuisance today.

476
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,603
I know it's my fault
we hit the deer.

477
00:17:17,605 --> 00:17:20,039
And I know you wanted
to be the one to save it.

478
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,541
Whatever.

479
00:17:21,543 --> 00:17:23,976
How petty would I have to be
to care less

480
00:17:23,978 --> 00:17:26,145
about an animal's life
than my own ego?

481
00:17:26,147 --> 00:17:29,248
Well, you'd have
to be pretty petty.

482
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,617
But you'd still be
the woman I married.

483
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:33,820
Where are we going?

484
00:17:33,822 --> 00:17:36,055
One last stop.

485
00:17:38,626 --> 00:17:40,593
Where's the helicopter?

486
00:17:40,595 --> 00:17:42,094
There is no helicopter.

487
00:17:42,096 --> 00:17:44,464
And there is
no Cervine Institute.

488
00:17:44,466 --> 00:17:46,232
But the top deer surgeon...

489
00:17:46,234 --> 00:17:47,433
I'm looking at her.

490
00:17:47,435 --> 00:17:48,968
Thanks for teeing me
up like that.

491
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,503
You better get moving.

492
00:17:50,505 --> 00:17:52,438
These lights are designed
for basic ice-cream work.

493
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,840
They're not gonna last
all night.

494
00:17:53,842 --> 00:17:55,608
I need five minutes.

495
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:29,976
Jerry, this was the most
romantic weekend I've ever had.

496
00:18:29,978 --> 00:18:32,211
Thanks to cold stone creamery.

497
00:18:32,213 --> 00:18:34,113
You're welcome.

498
00:18:34,115 --> 00:18:35,648
Okay, collars are done.
Put them on.

499
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:38,117
We're out of time.
It's ironic, huh?

500
00:18:39,787 --> 00:18:41,387
Huh? Wait a minute.

501
00:18:41,389 --> 00:18:42,889
- Great.
- Rick!

502
00:18:42,891 --> 00:18:44,123
What's going on?

503
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,491
The collar.
Oh, the latch is broken.

504
00:18:45,493 --> 00:18:46,859
It won't latch closed
around my neck.

505
00:18:46,861 --> 00:18:48,995
- Oh, are you kidding me?
- Geez, what's going on?

506
00:18:48,997 --> 00:18:50,363
How come our collars
aren't green?

507
00:18:50,365 --> 00:18:51,998
Obviously because someone
doesn't know how to put

508
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,133
his collar on, and one of me
is stuck trying to help him.

509
00:18:54,135 --> 00:18:56,636
Don't blame this on me. You're the
one that couldn't fix a latch.

510
00:18:56,638 --> 00:18:58,504
What are you talking about?
It's not broken, Morty.

511
00:18:58,506 --> 00:18:59,539
I fixed it.
Just put it on.

512
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:01,307
It won't close.
It's broken.

513
00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:03,042
Fine, bring it here.

514
00:19:03,044 --> 00:19:04,677
Oh!

515
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:06,145
- Rick!
- Morty!

516
00:19:07,482 --> 00:19:09,048
Oh, really, Morty?
Well, I'm sorry.

517
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,651
I'm not the one who's so [bleep]
uncertain about everything.

518
00:19:11,653 --> 00:19:13,319
You know what
I'm certain of, Rick?

519
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:14,987
I've really made up
my mind about this.

520
00:19:14,989 --> 00:19:16,422
I never want to see you again!

521
00:19:16,424 --> 00:19:18,891
You're never gonna see anything
again, you little dummy!

522
00:19:18,893 --> 00:19:20,059
You killed us!

523
00:19:20,061 --> 00:19:22,828
God damn it.

524
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,330
♪♪

525
00:19:27,602 --> 00:19:29,068
Rick! Oh!

526
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,570
Morty, where's your collar?
I'll fix it.

527
00:19:30,572 --> 00:19:32,738
I dropped it.

528
00:19:34,008 --> 00:19:36,842
What the hell?
What have you done to me, Morty?

529
00:19:38,246 --> 00:19:40,746
I'm okay with this.
Be good, Morty.

530
00:19:40,748 --> 00:19:43,483
Be better than me.

531
00:19:44,285 --> 00:19:45,952
Oh [bleep] the other collar!

532
00:19:45,954 --> 00:19:48,287
I'm not okay with this.
I am not okay with this!

533
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:49,755
Oh, sweet Jesus,
please let me live.

534
00:19:49,757 --> 00:19:52,091
Oh, my God, I have to...
I've got to fix this thing.

535
00:19:52,093 --> 00:19:53,960
Please, God in heaven.
Please, God.

536
00:19:53,962 --> 00:19:55,261
Oh, lord, hear my prayers.

537
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,263
Yes!
[Bleep] you, God!

538
00:19:57,265 --> 00:19:58,864
Not today, bitch!

539
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:02,068
Please, God, if there's a hell,
please be merciful to me.

540
00:20:03,705 --> 00:20:06,205
Yes, I did it!
There is no God!

541
00:20:06,207 --> 00:20:07,773
In your face!

542
00:20:07,775 --> 00:20:09,241
One dot, mother[bleep]!

543
00:20:09,243 --> 00:20:11,577
- Yes!
- Oh, yes!

544
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:13,279
All right, you know
what I'm talking about.

545
00:20:13,281 --> 00:20:14,714
- Oh, that was a close call.
- Oh, yeah!

546
00:20:14,716 --> 00:20:16,282
I'm gonna do
the cabbage patch, Morty.

547
00:20:16,284 --> 00:20:17,550
- Oh, yeah, do it.
- Check me out.

548
00:20:17,552 --> 00:20:18,784
I'm doing the cabbage patch.

549
00:20:18,786 --> 00:20:20,386
- Do it right.
- I'm doing it, too.

550
00:20:20,388 --> 00:20:21,787
- Do the cabbage patch.
- It's a classic dance.

551
00:20:21,789 --> 00:20:23,623
- Do it. Do the dance.
- Oh [bleep] look at that.

552
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,758
Hey, wait a second, how come you
guys took longer to get here?

553
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,061
I don't know. I think, like,
1/64 of my collars didn't work.

554
00:20:29,063 --> 00:20:30,496
It's hard to keep straight now

555
00:20:30,498 --> 00:20:32,999
that I have 63 other memories
of everything.

556
00:20:33,001 --> 00:20:34,233
Yeah.

557
00:20:34,235 --> 00:20:36,002
But I feel like one
of the 64 Ricks,

558
00:20:36,004 --> 00:20:37,503
like, sacrificed
himself for me?

559
00:20:37,505 --> 00:20:40,006
- Maybe? I think?
- Shut up, Morty.

560
00:20:40,008 --> 00:20:42,808
The last time you felt
something, we all almost died.

561
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:44,076
You little piece of shit.

562
00:20:44,078 --> 00:20:45,444
Hey, guys, we're home.

563
00:20:45,446 --> 00:20:46,812
Mom! Dad!

564
00:20:46,814 --> 00:20:48,347
Uh, hold the phone.

565
00:20:48,349 --> 00:20:50,783
Where did you guys
get those necklaces from?

566
00:20:50,785 --> 00:20:53,319
Uh, Lady Gaga, table for three.
Am I right?

567
00:20:53,321 --> 00:20:55,521
Are you guys Power Rangers,

568
00:20:55,523 --> 00:20:57,256
but only on one small part
of your necks?

569
00:20:57,258 --> 00:20:58,691
Hey, do those things
need batteries?

570
00:20:58,693 --> 00:21:00,526
Were they included?
Cleanup in the fruit aisle.

571
00:21:00,528 --> 00:21:02,528
Not in a homophobic way, though.

572
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,025
They're just fruity necklaces
is what I was saying.

573
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:04,830
I'm gonna pee my pants!

574
00:21:04,832 --> 00:21:07,333
- Somebody call the planet of "tron"!
- Doesn't feel so good, does it?

575
00:21:07,335 --> 00:21:10,169
- We have three "tron" people over here.
- No, it doesn't. It hurts.

576
00:21:10,171 --> 00:21:12,271
Seriously, are these
Halloween costumes?

577
00:21:12,273 --> 00:21:13,673
Are you going as motorcycles

578
00:21:13,675 --> 00:21:16,142
with green headlights
instead of normal ones?

579
00:21:16,144 --> 00:21:18,044
Are you dogs?
Robot dogs?

580
00:21:18,046 --> 00:21:19,679
Gosh, you guys are lame.

581
00:21:19,681 --> 00:21:21,814
Are those chokers from the '90s?

582
00:21:21,816 --> 00:21:24,183
What is this,
a '90s nostalgia thing?

583
00:21:24,185 --> 00:21:28,454
Are you guys in that movie
"The Craft" with Fairuza Balk?

00:22:04,492 --> 00:22:06,592
Hey, man,
when the hell were you?

586
00:22:06,594 --> 00:22:09,729
- Looking for you, asshole.
- I told you past the dinosaurs.

587
00:22:09,731 --> 00:22:12,198
You know how much time
is past the dinosaurs?

588
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,399
Half of all time!

589
00:22:13,401 --> 00:22:14,533
Come on, man.
It's this way.

590
00:22:14,535 --> 00:22:15,735
- Come on.
- Give me that thing.

591
00:22:15,737 --> 00:22:17,369
Speed it up.
He can't be this far back.

592
00:22:17,371 --> 00:22:19,172
No, no, there he is.
There he is. There he is.

593
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:20,506
There he is.
Stop, stop.

594
00:22:20,508 --> 00:22:21,941
- So, that's the guy, huh?
- Yeah, that's him.

595
00:22:21,943 --> 00:22:23,676
Hey, man.
Remember me?

596
00:22:23,678 --> 00:22:25,411
I got something for your ass.

597
00:22:25,413 --> 00:22:27,346
Don't... mess... with time!

598
00:22:27,348 --> 00:22:29,415
You don't [bleep] with time!

599
00:22:29,417 --> 00:22:31,951
Mother[bleep]!

600
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:38,224
I will mess with time.

601
00:22:38,226 --> 00:22:41,127
I will mess with time.

602
00:22:42,563 --> 00:22:43,929
Did you get any of that?

603
00:22:43,931 --> 00:22:46,365
It's a good show.
