<i>Are we -- are we gonna put it
back when we're done with it?</i>

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,580
<i> Why? The only thing of value on
  it is the secret treasure map.</i>

3
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,190
<i>   The rest is just instructions
          for running a country,</i>

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:14,850
<i>             And I'm pretty sure
               they're online.</i>

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,320
<i>It just feels a little wrong --</i>

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,920
<i>Morty, are you gonna be
a [bleep] america nerd</i>

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,060
<i>Or are you gonna be cool</i>

8
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,690
<i>      And steal the constitution
                with grandpa?</i>

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,200
<i>Here, hold this while I
crack the hermetic seal.</i>

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,270
<i>      W-why not
just use this again?</i>

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,140
<i>                   Morty!
      You just destroyed the map</i>

12
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,540
<i>And activated the giant assassin
hidden in the statue of liberty!</i>

13
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,080
<i>    I'm sorry --
    w-wait, what?</i>

14
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,350
<i>   It was a trojan horse, morty.
         Never trust the french.</i>

                 Way to go.</i>

17
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:47,490
<i>    And on america's birthday</i>

18
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,220
<i>Or whatever the [bleep]
  thanksgiving is.</i>

19
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,860
<i>        Seal team leader:
         Rick and morty!</i>

00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,390
<i>      You are under arrest
         and surrounded</i>

21
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:26,860
<i>   By an anti-portal shimmer!</i>

22
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,130
<i>            Come out
       with your hands up!</i>

23
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,000
<i>                    Well,
       happy thanksgiving to me.</i>

<i>          Can't wait to see what
a "shimmer" does to my prostate.</i>

<i> Dad, can you please
just end whatever this is --</i>

26
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,470
<i>      I understand you're upset,
               mr. President.</i>

27
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,200
<i>                It's honestly
             all morty's fault.</i>

28
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,010
<i> But in the meantime, you really
          want to keep your army</i>

29
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:42,610
<i>      Of pointlessly camouflaged
       eagle scouts off my lawn.</i>

30

<i>   Don't tell me what I want,
        you anti-american</i>

31

         you terrorist!</i>

32
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,350
<i>     You know, you use that word
                   so much</i>

33
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,810
<i>          It's lost all meaning,
                   mr. P.</i>

34
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,420
<i>       It's like, at this point,
             what's a terrorist?</i>

35
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,220
<i>      It's a guy you don't like.
                  Big deal.</i>

36
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,550
<i>            Hoo-rah!</i>

37
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,620
<i>          [ screaming ]</i>

38
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,820
<i>Told you to stand down.</i>

39
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,290
<i>You just lost two soldiers
over here. Good men.</i>

40
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,030
<i>Might be time to look
at the terrorist in the mirror.</i>

41
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,500
<i>        You want a war?!</i>

42
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,770
<i>  I'll put your outer-space ass
    in a goddamn phantom zone</i>

43
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,500
<i>  With a bar of kryptonite soap
        around your neck.</i>

44
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,440
<i>      You're done, sanchez!
          You hear me?</i>

45
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,970
<i>        Oof.
He's really pissed this time.</i>

46
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,570
<i> Why don't you guys just [bleep]
           and get it over with.</i>

47
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,840
<i>Okay, well thank you,
       summer,</i>

48
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,310
<i>     But I think
I've got a better option.</i>

49
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,640
<i>  Dad, no.
             Ehh...</i>

50
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,180
<i>         Hands are tied,
            sweetie.</i>

51
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,780
<i>   I have to turn myself into
a turkey and trick the president</i>

52
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,720
<i>         Into giving me
  a presidential turkey pardon.</i>

53
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,920
<i>Again? How many times
 have you done this?</i>

54
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,450
<i>  I don't know, jerry, how many
    years have I lived here?</i>

55
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,920
<i>  Careful how you answer that.</i>

56
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,860
<i>             Geez, rick, y'know,
       y-you've done this a lot.</i>

57
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,790
<i>   Don't you think the president
  might see it coming this time?</i>

58
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,590
<i>    He probably will, morty.
  That's all part of the dance.</i>

59
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,930
<i>          In the past,
      I've inserted myself</i>

60
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,060
<i>    Into the potential turkey
       pardonee population</i>

61
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,530
<i>         By brainwashing
the presidential turkey wrangler</i>

62
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,070
<i>     Prior to the ceremony.</i>

63
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,400
<i>    But this time, the turkey
   wrangler's been euthanized</i>

64
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,540
<i>         And the turkeys
       will be transported</i>

65
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,210
<i>  By armored military vehicles.</i>

66
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:49,740
<i> Vehicles manufactured by ghost
  corporations that I control.</i>

67
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,280

69

<i>    Real armored transports,
      which he can never...</i>

70
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,350
<i>          Totally track
        and sneak aboard.</i>

71
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,950
<i>      And even if he does,
       he'll be on a truck</i>

72
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,420
<i>         Full of turkeys
    and fully armed marines.</i>

73
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,360
<i>     Who won't recognize me
      because the human eye</i>

74
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,090
<i>    Is inherently face blind
           to turkeys.</i>

75
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:08,030
<i>  President: Fortunately, those
 marines won't have human eyes.</i>

76
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,630
<i>    They'll have turkey eyes.</i>

77
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,560
<i>Jesus ever-loving christ,
  why don't you two</i>

78
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,500

and get it over with?</i>

79
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,370
<i>              Careful, dwayne.
      You're only vice president</i>

80
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,100
<i>             Because I need 10%
             of the white vote.</i>
