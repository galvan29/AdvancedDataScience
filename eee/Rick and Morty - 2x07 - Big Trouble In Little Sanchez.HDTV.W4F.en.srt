1
00:00:01,396 --> 00:00:03,930
What's new at school?
- Nothing.

2
00:00:03,932 --> 00:00:06,600
Nothing! Oh, uh, one
of the lunch ladies died.

3
00:00:06,602 --> 00:00:08,235
They found her in the gym with,
like, two holes in her neck

4
00:00:08,237 --> 00:00:10,303
and all the blood drained
out of her.

5
00:00:10,305 --> 00:00:12,139
Good lord! Who does
something like that?

6
00:00:12,141 --> 00:00:14,741
Obviously a vampire.
W-w-where's the pepper?

7
00:00:14,742 --> 00:00:16,410
Wait, what?!
Vampires are real?!

8
00:00:16,411 --> 00:00:19,346
Yes, Summer, vampires
are real. Who knew?

9
00:00:19,347 --> 00:00:22,315
Oh, right, all humanity,
for hundreds of years, now.

10
00:00:22,317 --> 00:00:23,483
Yeah, Summer,
it's a big universe.

11
00:00:23,486 --> 00:00:26,018
Get used to it.
R-right, Rick?

12
00:00:26,021 --> 00:00:27,353
Well, what are we going to do?!

13
00:00:27,355 --> 00:00:29,088
We're gonna live our lives
until we die.

14
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,457
Possibly by vampire.
More likely auto accident

15
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,660
or heart disease,
but possibly vampire.

16
00:00:33,662 --> 00:00:36,596
Grandpa Rick, couldn't you,
like, use your superknowledge

17
00:00:36,599 --> 00:00:39,666
to turn yourself into a teenager
and come to our school

18
00:00:39,668 --> 00:00:42,502
and help us hunt
the vampire down?

19
00:00:42,504 --> 00:00:43,604
Um... wow.

20
00:00:43,605 --> 00:00:46,172
Yeah, pretty specific
pitch, Summer.

21
00:00:46,175 --> 00:00:48,809
<i>I probably could
turn myself into a teenager</i>

22
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,345
and hang out in the
zit-covered, hormone-addled,

23
00:00:51,346 --> 00:00:53,647
low-stakes assworld
that is high school.

24
00:00:53,648 --> 00:00:55,349
But here's my reverse-ask...

25
00:00:55,351 --> 00:00:58,184
Why in the [Bleep]
would I ever do that, ever?

26
00:00:58,187 --> 00:01:01,020
And how dare you
even ask me that?

27
00:01:01,023 --> 00:01:02,489
And why aren't you more
ashamed of yourself?

28
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:03,389
Dad!

29
00:01:03,392 --> 00:01:05,192
Be ashamed of yourself, sweetie.

30
00:01:05,193 --> 00:01:06,392
Jerry! Do you know what you
just said to our daughter?

31
00:01:06,394 --> 00:01:08,728
Sor-ry! I wasn't
paying attention.

32
00:01:08,731 --> 00:01:11,163
To a conversation
about vampires?!

33
00:01:11,165 --> 00:01:13,900
Clearly, I didn't know
it was about vampires,

34
00:01:13,903 --> 00:01:15,736
because I wasn't
paying attention,

35
00:01:15,737 --> 00:01:17,638
<i>which you would know,
if you ever</i>

36
00:01:17,639 --> 00:01:18,971
<i>paid attention to me!</i>

37
00:01:18,974 --> 00:01:20,874
Oh, here we go,
right to the victim role.

38
00:01:20,876 --> 00:01:22,209
Am I a victim, Beth,

39
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,578
or am I married
to a mean, unfair monster

40
00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:25,978
that always hurts me?!

41
00:01:25,981 --> 00:01:27,513
Jesus Christ!

42
00:01:27,516 --> 00:01:29,555
Will you fix your marriage
or get a divorce already?

43
00:01:31,052 --> 00:01:34,821
Well, we tried
a couples' therapist.

44
00:01:34,822 --> 00:01:36,322
That's earth therapy.

45
00:01:36,325 --> 00:01:38,225
You might as well ask a horse
to fix a merry-go-round.

46
00:01:38,227 --> 00:01:39,692
I mean, he'll try his best,
but mostly,

47
00:01:39,695 --> 00:01:41,227
he's just gonna get horrified.

48
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:44,096
I know about a place off-planet
with a 100% success rate.

49
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:46,833
Well, we want to make it
work, if we can.

50
00:01:46,834 --> 00:01:48,067
It's just...
- then it's settled.

51
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,403
No need to pack.
- Oh!

52
00:01:49,404 --> 00:01:51,171
Let's go, go, go, go!

53
00:01:51,172 --> 00:01:54,407
Do you think mom and dad
are, you know,

54
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:55,441
gonna get a divorce?

55
00:01:55,443 --> 00:01:57,344
I think it's okay
to dream, Morty.

56
00:01:57,346 --> 00:02:01,514
I'm gonna go make
some wooden stakes.

57
00:02:25,538 --> 00:02:30,538
-Sync by ButterFox-

58
00:02:33,147 --> 00:02:35,715
I booked you for a two-day
intensive at nuptia four,

59
00:02:35,718 --> 00:02:38,552
the galaxy's most successful
couples' counseling institute.

60
00:02:38,553 --> 00:02:40,087
They could save the marriage
of a dog

61
00:02:40,089 --> 00:02:41,755
and a bar of dark chocolate.

62
00:02:41,757 --> 00:02:44,156
They could save the marriage
of a porn star and a porn star.

63
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:46,593
<i>Well, I know I'm ready
to try whatever it takes.</i>

64
00:02:46,595 --> 00:02:48,462
Which clearly implies
that I'm not.

65
00:02:48,464 --> 00:02:49,996
It's not a competition, Beth.

66
00:02:49,999 --> 00:02:51,298
Oh is that how you're
gonna try to win,

67
00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:53,000
<i>by implying I'm competitive?</i>

68
00:02:53,001 --> 00:02:54,300
If the shoe fits.

69
00:02:54,303 --> 00:02:55,501
My shoe fits up your ass.
You wish!

70
00:02:55,504 --> 00:02:56,970
Okay, have fun.
See ya Thursday!

71
00:02:56,971 --> 00:02:58,471
Oh!

72
00:02:58,474 --> 00:02:59,639
Jerk.

73
00:02:59,642 --> 00:03:01,240
Don't insult my father.

74
00:03:01,243 --> 00:03:03,243
He's the reason our kids
are only half-stupid.

75
00:03:03,244 --> 00:03:05,077
Ha! You just called
yourself...

76
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:06,145
Oh.

77
00:03:06,148 --> 00:03:07,981
Beth and Jerry Smith?
Yes.

78
00:03:07,982 --> 00:03:09,249
I'm glaxo slimslom.

79
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,250
Welcome to nuptia four.

80
00:03:11,252 --> 00:03:15,155
Your marriage can rest easy now.

81
00:03:15,156 --> 00:03:18,325
Jerry, go ahead and sit
there and put this on.

82
00:03:18,327 --> 00:03:20,861
This machine isolates
the part of the subject's brain

83
00:03:20,863 --> 00:03:24,331
containing all perceptions
of its romantic partner.

84
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:27,534
And we will now render
Jerry's perception of Beth

85
00:03:27,536 --> 00:03:31,171
with artificial biological life.

86
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:35,541
Interesting.

87
00:03:35,543 --> 00:03:37,209
What the hell is that?!
Take that back!

88
00:03:37,212 --> 00:03:39,046
<i>You do not think that about me!</i>

89
00:03:39,048 --> 00:03:40,312
I didn't do anything!

90
00:03:40,315 --> 00:03:41,614
They scanned it out of my brain.

91
00:03:41,617 --> 00:03:42,715
Can I take it back?

92
00:03:42,718 --> 00:03:44,517
There's nothing to regret.
We're dealing with

93
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:46,519
unconscious, unhealthy thoughts.

94
00:03:46,522 --> 00:03:47,787
Beth.

95
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,791
Now, we scan for Beth's
perceptions of Jerry.

96
00:03:50,793 --> 00:03:52,159
Scan hard.
He's dead to me.

97
00:03:52,161 --> 00:03:53,359
Everything's dead to you.

98
00:03:53,362 --> 00:03:54,727
What?
Nothing.

99
00:04:00,202 --> 00:04:02,135
Read it and weep, bitch.

100
00:04:02,137 --> 00:04:03,804
Does everybody see what I mean?

101
00:04:03,805 --> 00:04:06,540
I think we all see
what you both mean.

102
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,910
Any leads on the vampire?

103
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:11,377
No, Summer!
I mean, you know,

104
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,746
I think it might be time
that we just l-let it go.

105
00:04:13,749 --> 00:04:15,514
<i>Oh, so, now, you're
too cool for this,</i>

106
00:04:15,517 --> 00:04:16,817
just because grandpa Rick is?

107
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:18,651
It's not that, it's just
that the universe

108
00:04:18,654 --> 00:04:21,087
is a little too big to care
about something so small.

109
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:22,089
Aah!

110
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:23,724
What up, my Helsings?

111
00:04:23,726 --> 00:04:25,425
Who wants to hunt
a vampire? Ha ha ha!

112
00:04:25,426 --> 00:04:27,159
Rick?
How... how did you...

113
00:04:27,161 --> 00:04:28,562
Yeah, I got bored
and then, I remembered,

114
00:04:28,563 --> 00:04:30,663
this morning, how I blew
Summer off, and I thought,

115
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,399
"hey, why are you such
a grumpy douche, Rick?

116
00:04:32,401 --> 00:04:33,933
Go to the garage,
transfer your mind

117
00:04:33,935 --> 00:04:36,103
into a younger clone of
yourself, and get embroiled

118
00:04:36,104 --> 00:04:38,238
in some youthful hijinks,
what's the bfd?"

119
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,005
So here I am.
I'm tiny Rick!

120
00:04:40,007 --> 00:04:41,575
O-o-okay.

121
00:04:41,577 --> 00:04:43,008
Well, it's good
you're here, Rick.

122
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,411
I was pretty sure we
didn't have what it takes

123
00:04:44,413 --> 00:04:46,046
to deal with
a bloodsucker on our own.

124
00:04:46,048 --> 00:04:47,546
Don't short-sell
yourself, Summer.

125
00:04:47,548 --> 00:04:49,449
You got everything it takes.
But it'll still be fun

126
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,017
to do this as a [Bleep] team,
mother[Bleep] tiny Rick!

127
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:55,187
Yeah! Oh, my God,
Toby Matthews!

128
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,123
Hey, Toby. I'm tiny Rick.
I'm new.

129
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,526
Hey oh... go easy on me.
Ha ha. Just kiddin'.

130
00:04:59,527 --> 00:05:02,094
I like your
straightforward style

131
00:05:02,096 --> 00:05:03,964
and that lab coat's pretty cool.

132
00:05:03,966 --> 00:05:05,298
Summer.

133
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,233
He knows my name!

134
00:05:07,236 --> 00:05:08,601
Why wouldn't he?
You're great!

135
00:05:08,603 --> 00:05:10,103
But, listen, just be careful.

136
00:05:10,104 --> 00:05:11,772
We can't rule anybody out
as the vampire,

137
00:05:11,774 --> 00:05:13,873
not even the dreamboats.

138
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,108
Stop, tiny Rick.

139
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,144
Huntin' a vampire
with my grandkids!

140
00:05:17,146 --> 00:05:19,312
[Bleep]! Tiny Ri-I-ck!

141
00:05:19,313 --> 00:05:21,781
The next step is
to watch your mythologues

142
00:05:21,784 --> 00:05:24,817
interact together
and, uh... big surprise...

143
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,118
It's never pretty.

144
00:05:27,555 --> 00:05:29,789
Here we have garrrh
and zharbidar gloompfschs,

145
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,757
or, should I say,
here we have the way

146
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,293
garrrh and zharbidar
perceive each other.

147
00:05:36,464 --> 00:05:37,930
As we can all see,

148
00:05:37,933 --> 00:05:40,300
this is hardly the real
garrrh and zharbidar.

149
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:42,002
Which is good,
because the relationship

150
00:05:42,003 --> 00:05:44,570
in their heads is not only ugly,

151
00:05:44,572 --> 00:05:47,106
<i>it's unsustainable.</i>

152
00:05:49,911 --> 00:05:52,846
You may already be
learning something important...

153
00:05:52,848 --> 00:05:55,315
All of these relationships
are different,

154
00:05:55,317 --> 00:05:58,584
none of them are real,
and none of them work.

155
00:05:58,587 --> 00:06:01,822
We are not the monsters
we sometimes see each other as,

156
00:06:01,824 --> 00:06:05,591
because we are real
and we are functional.

157
00:06:05,594 --> 00:06:08,962
That's what makes us
better than them.

158
00:06:08,964 --> 00:06:11,798
We can find solutions.

159
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,832
We can adapt.

160
00:06:12,834 --> 00:06:14,668
We can communicate.

161
00:06:15,536 --> 00:06:18,839
And, most importantly,

162
00:06:18,841 --> 00:06:23,844
we can work together.

163
00:06:23,846 --> 00:06:26,680
Well, it was a tough adventure,
but it paid off...

164
00:06:26,681 --> 00:06:28,348
Our school is vampire-free!

165
00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:30,983
Man, who would've
suspected coach feratu?

166
00:06:30,986 --> 00:06:33,452
You did great, guys. Couldn't
have done it without ya.

167
00:06:33,454 --> 00:06:35,021
You know, we... w-we
should be proud of ourselves.

168
00:06:35,022 --> 00:06:37,524
<i>We killed a vampire
and a gym teacher.</i>

169
00:06:37,526 --> 00:06:39,625
Ha ha ha. Talk
about two-for-one, right?!

170
00:06:39,627 --> 00:06:41,861
So, how, exactly,
is your old body living

171
00:06:41,863 --> 00:06:42,962
in there, grandpa Rick?

172
00:06:42,964 --> 00:06:44,531
Oh, you know,
hyperbaric quantum fluid,

173
00:06:44,532 --> 00:06:46,031
That kind of thing.

174
00:06:46,034 --> 00:06:47,968
It preserves living tissue.
Not that there was much

175
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:51,036
to preserve. Look at that
mummy! Ha! Ha ha!

176
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:53,806
And I guess it's time for me to
get back inside the old-timer.

177
00:06:53,808 --> 00:06:57,543
Oh, my God. Toby Matthews
is asking if my parents

178
00:06:57,546 --> 00:06:59,045
are still out of town and
if we can have a party!

179
00:06:59,046 --> 00:07:01,680
All right, way to go, Summer!
What did I tell you?

180
00:07:01,683 --> 00:07:04,985
Ohh! He's asking
if tiny Rick will be here.

181
00:07:04,986 --> 00:07:06,353
Well, you know what, Summer?

182
00:07:06,354 --> 00:07:08,187
<i>Tell him tiny Rick will be here!</i>

183
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,555
And tell him to bring
some brews!

184
00:07:09,558 --> 00:07:12,759
For real? Y-y-y-you
would stay as tiny Rick,

185
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,226
just so we can have a party?

186
00:07:14,228 --> 00:07:15,861
Hell, yeah!
What's one more night?

187
00:07:15,863 --> 00:07:18,565
And who can have fun with this
old bastard hanging around, huh?

188
00:07:18,567 --> 00:07:21,233
Wubby lubby doob doob!

189
00:07:21,236 --> 00:07:23,069
Whoo!
- Tiny Rick!

190
00:07:25,072 --> 00:07:28,108
Moving on. Now,
we have Beth and Jerry Smith

191
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,909
from the planet e-arth.

192
00:07:29,911 --> 00:07:31,077
My heart is pounding.

193
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:32,245
This is gonna be great.

194
00:07:32,247 --> 00:07:33,913
The e-arth relationships
are simpler.

195
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:36,582
It's a primitive planet,
so their dysfunctions are oh...

196
00:07:36,584 --> 00:07:38,418
W-wait, what?
What's going on?

197
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,185
Where are the Smith mythologues?

198
00:07:45,192 --> 00:07:46,593
Oh, my God.

199
00:07:48,397 --> 00:07:49,396
Aah! Aah!

200
00:07:49,397 --> 00:07:52,531
Oh, my God.
Secure the cell!

201
00:07:52,534 --> 00:07:54,433
Aaaah!

202
00:07:54,435 --> 00:07:56,769
Uh, hey! You know what's fun?
Our gift shop.

203
00:07:56,772 --> 00:07:58,904
Why don't we proceed
in an orderly...

204
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,276
Oh, dear God, no.

205
00:08:03,277 --> 00:08:05,111
They're codependent!

206
00:08:05,113 --> 00:08:06,312
Run!

207
00:08:08,716 --> 00:08:09,548
Oh!

208
00:08:14,543 --> 00:08:16,209
Oh, yeah, yeah,
you really know how

209
00:08:16,212 --> 00:08:18,579
to sport that color blue.
Really?

210
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,580
You're looking real good.
Oh, my God.

211
00:08:20,582 --> 00:08:22,716
Hey, Morty.
Oh, hey... hey, Jessica.

212
00:08:22,718 --> 00:08:26,652
So, is tiny Rick your
brother or cousin, or...?

213
00:08:26,654 --> 00:08:28,021
No, my grandpa just transferred

214
00:08:28,022 --> 00:08:29,755
his consciousness
into a clone of himself

215
00:08:29,757 --> 00:08:31,224
so he could be
in our high school.

216
00:08:31,226 --> 00:08:32,358
Cool.

217
00:08:32,361 --> 00:08:34,228
Hey, tiny Rick's playing guitar.

218
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:35,329
All right, everybody.

219
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,030
This next one's coming
straight from the heart.

220
00:08:37,031 --> 00:08:39,333
Making the lyrics up
right off the top of my head.

221
00:08:39,334 --> 00:08:40,834
♪ Let me out

222
00:08:40,835 --> 00:08:44,003
♪ what you see is not
the same person as me ♪

223
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:45,272
♪ My life's a lie

224
00:08:45,273 --> 00:08:46,873
♪ I'm not who
you're looking at ♪

225
00:08:46,874 --> 00:08:48,909
♪ Let me out, set me free

226
00:08:48,911 --> 00:08:50,911
♪ I'm really old;
This isn't me ♪

227
00:08:50,912 --> 00:08:56,349
♪ My real body's
slowly dyin' in a vat ♪

228
00:08:56,352 --> 00:08:58,084
♪ Is anybody listening'

229
00:08:58,086 --> 00:09:00,052
♪ can anyone understand?

230
00:09:00,055 --> 00:09:03,589

♪ Help me; I'm gonna die!

233
00:09:06,527 --> 00:09:08,262
Tiny Rick!
Thanks, everybody!

234
00:09:08,263 --> 00:09:09,695
This guy's amazing!

235
00:09:09,698 --> 00:09:10,696
I love tiny Rick!
Bad. Ass.

236
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:13,767
- Yeah!

237
00:09:22,611 --> 00:09:25,411
Aah!

238
00:09:32,253 --> 00:09:33,719
Huh?

239
00:09:33,722 --> 00:09:35,321
What the [Bleep]?

240
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:37,224
Yeah, I know! What kind
of operation are you running?

241
00:09:37,225 --> 00:09:40,160
Us?! What the hell kind of
relationship do you have?!

242
00:09:40,161 --> 00:09:41,627
Oh, right, blame this on us.

243
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:44,631
Okay, uh, I can and I am!

244
00:09:44,632 --> 00:09:48,468
Your demonized mythologizations
of each other are cooperating.

245
00:09:48,469 --> 00:09:49,935
Isn't that good?

246
00:09:49,938 --> 00:09:52,004
No. No! It's bad!

247
00:09:52,007 --> 00:09:54,974
You have the single worst
marriage I've ever witnessed.

248
00:09:54,977 --> 00:09:56,810
It shouldn't exist!

249
00:09:56,811 --> 00:09:58,945
<i>You should never, ever, ever,
have gotten together</i>

250
00:09:58,946 --> 00:10:01,647
<i>and I do not understand
how, or why,</i>

251
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,684
you would ever stay together.

252
00:10:03,685 --> 00:10:05,017
Aaah!

253
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,585
Well, this is just
bad couples' therapy.

254
00:10:06,588 --> 00:10:07,921
Totally.

255
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:14,761
Wait for us!

256
00:10:14,762 --> 00:10:16,095
There's only room for one more.

257
00:10:16,098 --> 00:10:17,531
I'm a therapist.
I'll talk to them.

258
00:10:17,532 --> 00:10:20,132
They're not therapists.
Go, go, go!

259
00:10:20,134 --> 00:10:22,469
There's gotta be a way
to contact my dad.

260
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,671
Let's find a control
room or something.

261
00:10:29,645 --> 00:10:32,179
Beth!
You'll want to see this.

262
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,280
What is it?

263
00:10:33,281 --> 00:10:34,613
It's a small, hinged panel

264
00:10:34,615 --> 00:10:37,117
with a tiny amount
of space behind it.

265
00:10:37,118 --> 00:10:38,785
If you can find one, too,

266
00:10:38,786 --> 00:10:42,155
we should be safe for hours,
maybe days!

267
00:10:42,156 --> 00:10:44,523
You stay put, Jerry.

268
00:10:44,526 --> 00:10:46,693
I'll send help, if I make it.

269
00:10:46,695 --> 00:10:49,195
You don't want to find
your own little hatch?

270
00:10:49,198 --> 00:10:51,964
Jerry, I believe that,
if you hide by yourself,

271
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:53,967
you might survive
and I believe I,

272
00:10:53,969 --> 00:10:56,802
by myself, have a shot
of getting out of here,

273
00:10:56,805 --> 00:10:59,238
but the two of us, together?

274
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,373
I don't know.

275
00:11:00,376 --> 00:11:02,408
Look, maybe the shrink
was right.

276
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:05,978
Good luck.

277
00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:09,015
All right, now,
you listen to me.

278
00:11:09,017 --> 00:11:10,483
Oh! Or don't.

279
00:11:10,485 --> 00:11:12,219
Hey! Don't! Please!

280
00:11:15,056 --> 00:11:16,656
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!

281
00:11:16,657 --> 00:11:18,657
Now, I know I've said,
in the past,

282
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,326
that math is important...
And it is!...

283
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:23,162
But I also think that,
one day, you'll all look back

284
00:11:23,165 --> 00:11:26,999
on being in high school
with tiny Rick and Morty,

285
00:11:27,002 --> 00:11:29,703
who I hear had a great
party last night.

286
00:11:29,704 --> 00:11:31,905
So, class dismissed.

287
00:11:31,906 --> 00:11:33,172
You've got the day off!

288
00:11:33,175 --> 00:11:35,342
All right! Good work,
Mr. goldenfold!

289
00:11:35,344 --> 00:11:37,511
Yeah, get outside.
Read a book.

290
00:11:37,512 --> 00:11:38,945
Put on some sunscreen, Danielle!

291
00:11:38,946 --> 00:11:40,579
Hey, what's up, Summer?
Ooh, nice top.

292
00:11:40,581 --> 00:11:42,748
Thanks. Tiny Rick,
you think you might be

293
00:11:42,751 --> 00:11:44,718
getting back into
your old body tonight?

294
00:11:44,719 --> 00:11:46,353
No can do. Tonight's
the big dance

295
00:11:46,354 --> 00:11:48,888
and Morty's bringing Jessica.
He needs his tiny wing man.

296
00:11:48,891 --> 00:11:50,924
Tiny Rick!

297
00:11:50,925 --> 00:11:53,560
Okay, but if not tonight, when?

298
00:11:53,561 --> 00:11:54,761
I don't know.
When I feel like it?

299
00:11:54,762 --> 00:11:57,196
Damn, girl!
You need to chill out!

300
00:11:57,199 --> 00:11:59,132
This whole thing was your
idea, in the first place,

301
00:11:59,133 --> 00:12:00,767
and, now, you're trying
to rush it along.

302
00:12:00,768 --> 00:12:02,602
Yeah, and you know what?
I like high school.

303
00:12:02,603 --> 00:12:04,204
I like hanging out.
Tiny Rick!

304
00:12:04,205 --> 00:12:07,306
But what if the you
that likes it isn't you?

305
00:12:08,877 --> 00:12:09,776
Oh!

306
00:12:09,777 --> 00:12:11,044
Oh, Summer!

307
00:12:11,046 --> 00:12:12,646
It's just Rick
in a younger body.

308
00:12:12,647 --> 00:12:13,879
What's the... what's...
What's... what's...

309
00:12:13,882 --> 00:12:15,248
What's the...
What's the problem?

310
00:12:15,249 --> 00:12:17,383
Look at his art, Morty.

311
00:12:17,386 --> 00:12:18,484
I've got an emo streak.

312
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:19,752
It's part of what
makes me so rad.

313
00:12:19,754 --> 00:12:22,421
Why does it say "help me
Morty and Summer!"?

314
00:12:22,424 --> 00:12:25,057
Come on, Summer, that's
the title of the art.

315
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,493
<i>Why was knight rider
called knight rider?</i>

316
00:12:26,494 --> 00:12:29,329
The car's name was kitt.
Nobody rode Michael knight.

317
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:31,730
You're overthinking it, Summer.
I'm tiny Rick!

318
00:12:31,733 --> 00:12:34,468
Grandpa, I think that,
when you put your mind

319
00:12:34,469 --> 00:12:35,634
into this body's young brain,

320
00:12:35,637 --> 00:12:37,304
it did what young brains do...

321
00:12:37,305 --> 00:12:39,339
It shoved the bad
thoughts into the back

322
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,840
and put a wall around them.

323
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,743
But those bad thoughts
are the real Rick.

324
00:12:43,744 --> 00:12:45,244
The fact that you're old,
the fact that

325
00:12:45,247 --> 00:12:46,912
we're all going to die,
one day, the fact that

326
00:12:46,915 --> 00:12:49,081
the universe is so big,
nothing in it matters,

327
00:12:49,084 --> 00:12:51,117
those facts are who you are.

328
00:12:51,118 --> 00:12:52,819
So you're trapped in there
and you can only

329
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,589
come out in the form of
tiny Rick's teen angst!

330
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:58,023
<i>Well, Summer, I hear</i>

331
00:12:58,026 --> 00:13:00,526
Toby Matthews isn't
into psycho chicks.

332
00:13:00,528 --> 00:13:01,961
Can't think of anyone that is.

333
00:13:01,964 --> 00:13:04,631
I'll see you mother[Bleep]
at the dance! Tiny Rick!

334
00:13:04,632 --> 00:13:06,166
Morty, you have to help me!

335
00:13:06,167 --> 00:13:08,701
Summer, he's happy!
I'm happy!

336
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,136
I-I-is that why
you're doing this,

337
00:13:10,137 --> 00:13:11,938
you don't want me
and Rick to be happy?

338
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,939
No.

339
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,306
Well, then get
your shit together!

340
00:13:14,309 --> 00:13:17,009
Get it all together
and put it in a backpack.

341
00:13:17,012 --> 00:13:19,411
All your shit, so it's together.

342
00:13:20,547 --> 00:13:21,781
And if you gotta
take it somewhere,

343
00:13:21,782 --> 00:13:23,016
take it somewhere, you know?

344
00:13:23,017 --> 00:13:24,550
Take it to the
shit store and sell it

345
00:13:24,552 --> 00:13:27,119
o-or put it in a shit museum.

Thanks, kids.
You figured it out.

526
00:20:11,191 --> 00:20:12,525
Well, Summer did.

527
00:20:12,526 --> 00:20:14,192
Kind of weird that
you were that willing

528
00:20:14,194 --> 00:20:15,862
to sell my existence out
for some trim, Morty.

529
00:20:15,863 --> 00:20:17,363
What?!
Pants!

530
00:20:17,364 --> 00:20:19,364
But listen... I forgive you both
because you know what?

531
00:20:19,366 --> 00:20:21,267
I learned, today,
something important...

532
00:20:21,268 --> 00:20:22,936
The teenage mind
is its own worst enemy.

533
00:20:22,938 --> 00:20:24,269
Oh, I also learned this...

534
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:29,542
Operation Phoenix is not the
fallback I thought it would be.

535
00:20:29,544 --> 00:20:30,943
I guess it's back
to the drawing board.

536
00:20:30,946 --> 00:20:32,711
Oh, my God!

537
00:20:32,713 --> 00:20:33,712
Oh, my God!

538
00:20:33,715 --> 00:20:36,748
Oh, my God.
Put some pants on!

539
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,051
Put pants on.

540
00:20:38,053 --> 00:20:39,952
Grandpa's back, baby!

541
00:20:39,955 --> 00:20:41,219
<i>Grandpa's...</i>

542
00:20:41,221 --> 00:20:43,389
Oh, man, I gotta pick up
your parents.

543
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,057
They have been blowin' me up.

544
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:46,225
One last swing for the road!

545
00:20:46,227 --> 00:20:47,893
Aaaaaaaaaaah!

546
00:20:47,895 --> 00:20:49,562
For the love of God,
get dressed!

547
00:20:51,632 --> 00:20:54,167
So, what do you think?
You wanna

548
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,102
keep this marriage
going a while longer?

549
00:20:56,103 --> 00:20:59,805
At least until Morty has
graduated high school.

550
00:20:59,807 --> 00:21:00,940
Oh. Mm.

551
00:21:03,077 --> 00:21:05,478
Aha, you see?
What did I tell you two?

552
00:21:05,479 --> 00:21:06,478
It worked.

553
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,247
You know what, Rick?
I guess, in a way...

554
00:21:08,248 --> 00:21:10,450
Already lost interest.
Get in the car.

555
00:21:10,451 --> 00:21:11,784
I've been inside a kid
all day and, now,

556
00:21:11,786 --> 00:21:13,419
I can feel my bones
scraping each other.

557
00:21:13,421 --> 00:21:16,189
Uh, just so you're prepared,

558
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,757
there's a bunch of dead mes
in the garage.

559
00:21:17,758 --> 00:21:21,861
Huh! Sounds like our stories
were connected by a theme.

560
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,763
Not really, Jerry.

561
00:21:23,765 --> 00:21:27,132
<i>Probably a cosmetic connection
your mind mistakes for thematic.</i>

562
00:21:27,134 --> 00:21:28,334
Oh.

563
00:21:28,335 --> 00:21:30,769
Old Rick!
Ruinin' everything!

564
00:21:30,771 --> 00:21:32,372
♪

565
00:22:05,873 --> 00:22:06,972
Master.

566
00:22:06,975 --> 00:22:08,040
Speak.

567
00:22:08,043 --> 00:22:09,342
Coach feratu's presence

568
00:22:09,344 --> 00:22:11,143
was discovered by the humans.

569
00:22:11,145 --> 00:22:12,545
He has been destroyed.

570
00:22:12,546 --> 00:22:13,379
No bother.

571
00:22:13,381 --> 00:22:14,680
The mortals shall soon...

572
00:22:14,681 --> 00:22:16,082
I'm sorry, what did you
say his name was?

573
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,816
Coach feratu.
Coach feratu.

574
00:22:17,818 --> 00:22:20,318
That was his real name,
like his actual vampire name?

575
00:22:20,321 --> 00:22:22,488
No no no no. His vampire
name was balik alistane.

576
00:22:22,489 --> 00:22:23,989
Why the [Bleep]
would he name himself

577
00:22:23,991 --> 00:22:26,025
after a famous vampire movie?
Was he doing a bit?

578
00:22:26,026 --> 00:22:27,360
I do not know, your unholiness.

579
00:22:27,362 --> 00:22:28,861
Jesus [Bleep] Christ.

580
00:22:28,863 --> 00:22:31,596
From now on, no more of
this clever-name bullshit.

581
00:22:31,598 --> 00:22:33,266
When a vampire is pretending
to be a human,

582
00:22:33,267 --> 00:22:34,566
they can just call themselves

583
00:22:34,568 --> 00:22:36,401
Alan Jefferson
or something like that.

584
00:22:36,403 --> 00:22:37,670
It's crazy, right?

585
00:22:37,671 --> 00:22:39,171
I mean, am I being an asshole?

586
00:22:39,173 --> 00:22:40,672
Okay, I feel like
everybody in the room

587
00:22:40,674 --> 00:22:42,040
is looking at me like
I'm the buzzkill.

588
00:22:42,043 --> 00:22:43,109
I'm not?

589
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:46,679
Good. Okay. Great.

590
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,081
Oh, my g...!

591
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:49,515
Did you get any of that?

592
00:22:49,517 --> 00:22:51,683
It's-a good-a show!
