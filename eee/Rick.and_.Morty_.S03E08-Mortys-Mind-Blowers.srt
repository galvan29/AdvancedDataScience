Morty, hurry!

2
00:00:01,816 --> 00:00:04,014
Return the Truth Tortoise!

3
00:00:04,272 --> 00:00:06,491
Morty, whatever you do,
don't drop the Truth Tortoise!

4
00:00:06,561 --> 00:00:07,608
Also really important,

5
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,426
whatever you do,
don't look into its eyes!

6
00:00:09,474 --> 00:00:11,967
I... I did look at it, Rick!
I've been looking at it!

7
00:00:12,022 --> 00:00:13,583
Now you're gonna know
everything, Morty!

8
00:00:13,631 --> 00:00:15,530
- Good job! Way to go!
- You everything up!

9
00:00:17,335 --> 00:00:19,553
It's in my head!

10
00:00:19,842 --> 00:00:21,116
Ah!

11
00:00:24,867 --> 00:00:27,913
Oh, geez, I... I can't get that
Truth Tortoise out of my head.

12
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:29,898
Yeah, I told you not
to look into its eyes.

13
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:32,054
Hey, Morty, let's watch some
interdimensional cable.

14
00:00:32,102 --> 00:00:33,193
Remember how we used to do that?

15
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,679
Rick, I can't...
I can't go on.

16
00:00:34,727 --> 00:00:37,383
I-I can't go on like this with the
Truth Tortoise shit in my head.

17
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:38,648
I-I wish you could just...

18
00:00:38,726 --> 00:00:40,992
Erase the memory from your mind?

19
00:00:41,094 --> 00:00:42,773
How did you know
I was gonna say that?

20
00:00:42,851 --> 00:00:44,357
Come on, Morty, come with me.

21
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:46,484
After you.

22
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:49,390
What the hell is this?!

23
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,273
This, Morty, is my archive

24
00:00:51,336 --> 00:00:53,679
of all the experiences
you've begged me to remove

25
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,836
from your life,
lest you go insane.

26
00:00:55,906 --> 00:00:59,539
I call them
Morty's Mind Blowers.

27
00:00:59,664 --> 00:01:02,170
And we'll be doing this instead
of interdimensional cable.

How long have I been asking you
to remove memories?

36
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:38,497
Since the first time
your mind was blown.

37
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:39,880
Ahh, here it is.

38
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:41,160
Classic.

39
00:01:41,389 --> 00:01:42,561
There's no dust on it because

40
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:44,277
this isn't the first time
we've done this.

41
00:01:44,325 --> 00:01:48,200
- What?!
- I call this one "Moonspiracy"!

42
00:01:53,831 --> 00:01:56,435
Huh, wow.
That's incredible.

43
00:01:57,866 --> 00:01:59,347
What the heck?

44
00:02:00,925 --> 00:02:02,536
Morty, do you realize how
ridiculous that sounds?

45
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:04,707
Yeah, pretty crazy story, Morty.

46
00:02:04,755 --> 00:02:06,424
Are you serious?
Half the crap we've seen,

47
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,924
and you think that sounds crazy?

48
00:02:07,972 --> 00:02:09,729
I've been to 300 versions
of Earth's moon,

49
00:02:09,777 --> 00:02:11,605
including this one,
and I've never seen signs

50
00:02:11,675 --> 00:02:13,924
of a "regular dude,"
as you describe him,

51
00:02:13,972 --> 00:02:14,987
hanging out up there.

52
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:16,895
It's probably just
a smudge on the lens.

53
00:02:16,964 --> 00:02:20,293
Smudge on the lens?
Smudge on the lens?!

54
00:02:20,355 --> 00:02:22,510
I know the difference between
a man threatening me

55
00:02:22,558 --> 00:02:24,308
and a smudge on
the goddamn lens, Summer!

56
00:02:24,402 --> 00:02:26,363
Morty, calm down!
Are you feeling okay?

57
00:02:26,418 --> 00:02:27,886
I'm fine!

58
00:02:28,196 --> 00:02:29,582
So sensitive.

59
00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:33,746
Kids, I'd like to introduce you all

60
00:02:33,793 --> 00:02:36,761
to our new guidance counselor,
Mr. Lunas.

61
00:02:37,043 --> 00:02:39,441
I look forward
to helping guide you all

62
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:41,420
towards a brighter future.

63
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:44,056
I believe every
student should...

64
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:46,291
shoot for the moon.

66
00:02:50,894 --> 00:02:53,261

What's this?

68
00:02:57,324 --> 00:03:00,088
Proof that Mr. Lunas
isn't who he says he is!

69
00:03:00,136 --> 00:03:01,160
He's not a guidance counselor?

70
00:03:01,207 --> 00:03:04,074
I... I assume he's qualified
to be one, who isn't?

71
00:03:04,144 --> 00:03:07,316
But he also lives on the moon.

72
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,308
Okay.

73
00:03:09,433 --> 00:03:10,472
Hmm.

74
00:03:10,574 --> 00:03:11,886
Is that it?

75
00:03:11,972 --> 00:03:13,246
Is he doing anything
to hurt anyone?

76
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:14,878
Oh, he's up to something.

77
00:03:14,955 --> 00:03:17,293
I think I understand.

78
00:03:17,417 --> 00:03:19,464
"Up to something,"
"lives on the moon."

79
00:03:19,535 --> 00:03:20,933
Okay, I'll talk to him.

80
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:33,805
What did he say?

81
00:03:33,853 --> 00:03:36,260
Denied the moon stuff,
but that's what pedophiles do,

82
00:03:36,308 --> 00:03:37,628
they deny,
it's their bread and butter.

83
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:38,902
- Pedophile?
- You don't think so?

84
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:40,192
I thought the moon thing
might have been code.

85
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,346
No, he's literally
from the moon!

86
00:03:42,394 --> 00:03:43,527
Well, you saw him react.

87
00:03:43,575 --> 00:03:45,976
Moon or not,
that dude likes 'em young.

88
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,310
Gordon Lunas was a good Marine.

89
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:56,685
We don't know what drove
him to take his own life,

90
00:03:56,755 --> 00:03:58,458
but we want to remember
the good things.

91
00:03:58,532 --> 00:03:59,982
Like how, from a certain angle,

92
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,279
some people would say
he looked like a smudge.

93
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:09,873
Oh, my God, what have I done?

94
00:04:09,921 --> 00:04:11,279
What have I done?

95
00:04:12,201 --> 00:04:14,465
Jesus, I made that guy
kill himself!

96
00:04:14,513 --> 00:04:15,638
Only in a literal sense.

97
00:04:15,686 --> 00:04:18,740
Here's one I call
"Morty's Menagerie."

98
00:04:18,788 --> 00:04:19,920
They don't all
have titles, though.

99
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:21,568
It's not a "Simpsons"
Halloween special,

100
00:04:21,616 --> 00:04:25,155
more like a clip show made
of clips you never saw!

101
00:04:26,022 --> 00:04:28,505
I can't believe we got
put into a menagerie.

102
00:04:28,553 --> 00:04:30,372
So this guy collects
living beings?

103
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,060
Yeah, you know like
commemorative plates,

104
00:04:32,108 --> 00:04:33,115
but less off-putting.

105
00:04:33,163 --> 00:04:35,577
You'll get it when you're still
actively dating in your 40s.

106
00:04:35,717 --> 00:04:37,342
Assess this with
cold indifference,

107
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,764
you beany-headed prick!

108
00:04:39,256 --> 00:04:40,393
Hey, keep it down!

109
00:04:40,441 --> 00:04:42,349
Just our luck, menagerie beneath

110
00:04:42,397 --> 00:04:44,264
the "boulder people"
of Granitor Seven.

111
00:04:44,312 --> 00:04:45,728
I can't take it anymore, Rick!

112
00:04:46,103 --> 00:04:47,157
Relax, Morty!

113
00:04:47,214 --> 00:04:49,482
I can't relax! R-R-Rick, we...
We gotta get outta here!

114
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,170
I don't care what it takes!
Anything!

115
00:04:51,218 --> 00:04:52,607
- Anything?
- Anything!

116
00:04:52,655 --> 00:04:54,943
All right, well, you're gonna
have to take off your shirt.

117
00:04:54,991 --> 00:04:56,248
Not yet.
I'll tell you when.

118
00:05:01,787 --> 00:05:03,404
Dear God.

119
00:05:03,467 --> 00:05:04,763
What?

120
00:05:06,044 --> 00:05:07,918
The signal
turned out to be...

121
00:05:07,998 --> 00:05:09,389
There's no other way
to put it...

122
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:10,936
- Instructions.
- For?

123
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:14,256
A vehicle, sir,
an interstellar vehicle.

124
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,889
We'll need a pilot.
I wonder if there's a volunteer.

125
00:05:16,937 --> 00:05:17,941
Mm.

126
00:05:17,989 --> 00:05:21,092
Oh, the schematics specify
a second, smaller pilot.

127
00:05:21,179 --> 00:05:23,303
I mean, they really
specify smaller.

128
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,693
They have to be exactly 5'3".

129
00:05:25,771 --> 00:05:28,372
Chang, you may have majored
in Liberal Arts,

130
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,217
but I think you're about
to make history.

131
00:05:32,983 --> 00:05:34,389
Primary systems, check.

132
00:05:34,437 --> 00:05:36,170
Auxiliary systems, check.

00:05:41,538 --> 00:05:42,983
Okay, now.

- You look...

137

We've possessed forms
your mind can accept.

138
00:05:49,426 --> 00:05:51,793
Here are some customary
clothing gifts.

139
00:05:51,842 --> 00:05:53,381
Please, put them on.

140
00:05:53,467 --> 00:05:55,667
- May we?
- Of course, yes.

141
00:05:55,715 --> 00:05:57,182
We followed your instructions.

142
00:05:57,256 --> 00:06:00,022
We have so much
to learn from you.

143
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,912
I know, right?

144
00:06:07,872 --> 00:06:10,348

those other people's memories?

145

I... I wouldn't have been
around for that.

146
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,896
Yeah, sometimes I gotta do
a little editing, Morty.

147
00:06:13,943 --> 00:06:15,209
It helps the mind blowers

148
00:06:15,257 --> 00:06:16,911
play a little bit better
upon revisiting.

149
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,638

00:06:25,295 --> 00:06:26,342
I am Zikzak.

It's okay.
Here.

155
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:32,045

That's right, Morty.

The Floop Floopians achieve
an eternal orgasmic afterlife,

so long as they're killed

Thank you very much.

00:07:16,532 --> 00:07:18,889
Um, yeah, uh...

176
00:07:19,056 --> 00:07:23,289
otherwise,
how do you know if it's true?

177
00:07:25,397 --> 00:07:27,414
Wait, you don't...

178
00:07:28,424 --> 00:07:31,058
All right, so you want to do
this here or outside?

179
00:07:32,413 --> 00:07:33,569
Run!

180
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,972
I don't wanna die!

181
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,907
Oh, God, it's all real!
Oh, it hurts!

182
00:07:43,955 --> 00:07:45,521
Oh, I shouldn't have doubted it!

183
00:07:45,896 --> 00:07:48,075
I shouldn't have let
you make me doubt it!

184
00:07:48,132 --> 00:07:50,624
Aah!
I blame you, I blame you!

185
00:07:50,672 --> 00:07:52,304
But he said there
wasn't any evidence!

186
00:07:52,352 --> 00:07:53,554
That was a ton of evidence!

187
00:07:53,602 --> 00:07:54,691
Well, silver lining.

188
00:07:54,748 --> 00:07:55,945
Now I know their
religion's real.

189
00:07:55,992 --> 00:07:57,818
They have a hell,
and it does not look good.

190
00:07:57,952 --> 00:07:59,880
I noticed you never finished
your chimichanga,

191
00:07:59,928 --> 00:08:02,702
so I got some room for it now,
if you know what I mean.

192
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:04,369
Holy!

193
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,595
How many of these are just
horrible mistakes I've made?

194
00:08:06,643 --> 00:08:08,137
I mean, maybe
I'd stop making so many

195
00:08:08,185 --> 00:08:09,575
if I let myself learn from them!

196
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:11,397
Don't break your back
creating a lesson, Morty.

197
00:08:11,444 --> 00:08:12,723
It's a freeform anthology.

198
00:08:12,778 --> 00:08:14,253
I'm getting annoyed
you're not hearing that.

199
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,401
As you can see around me,
your mind's been blown

200
00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:20,512
countless times,
and not always by yourself.

201
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,345
Ah, ,
I don't even...

202
00:08:22,393 --> 00:08:23,779
This better not
have been a good one.

203
00:08:23,826 --> 00:08:24,840
What is this?

204
00:08:24,888 --> 00:08:26,903
Great, "Booger AIDS,"
"AIDS Booger."

205
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,524
I gotta start using
real file names.

206
00:08:28,572 --> 00:08:30,217
In the meantime,
enjoy a grab bag

207
00:08:30,265 --> 00:08:34,391
of mind blowers I call
"Poop AIDS underscore copy."

208
00:08:34,755 --> 00:08:37,198
I'm not an unreasonable man, 
Beth Smith.

209
00:08:37,248 --> 00:08:39,792
I know children are everything
to a mammal.

210
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,673
I will spare one of their lives.

211
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,530
You simply have to choose.

212
00:08:43,543 --> 00:08:45,955
- Summer!
- Summer.

213
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,221
♪♪

214
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:51,401
You're not gonna believe this.

215
00:08:51,449 --> 00:08:53,128
I went to Phoebe
instead of Titan.

216
00:08:53,176 --> 00:08:55,432
It's, like, hello, Saturn,
after ten moons,

217
00:08:55,511 --> 00:08:57,886
time to stop naming and start
numbering, you know?

218
00:08:57,979 --> 00:09:00,050
What's... Wh-What's with you
assholes?

219
00:09:00,604 --> 00:09:02,728
Morty, please, don't do this.

220
00:09:03,865 --> 00:09:06,110
Your Morty is gone!

221
00:09:06,229 --> 00:09:08,079
I am Voltamatron,
Destroyer of Worlds!

222
00:09:08,136 --> 00:09:10,703
Grandpa Rick, there must be some
scientific way to save him!

223
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,466
Not scientific,
but there may be a way.

224
00:09:12,524 --> 00:09:15,037
Morty, I know you're in there.
It's me, your grandpa.

225
00:09:15,172 --> 00:09:16,904
I know I can be mean,
but I love you, Morty.

226
00:09:16,952 --> 00:09:18,490
We all do,
you gotta fight this thing.

227
00:09:18,564 --> 00:09:20,459
I know you can.
You're stronger than all of us!

228
00:09:20,507 --> 00:09:22,824
Morty, it's mom! We love you,
you have to fight it!

229
00:09:22,872 --> 00:09:25,263
Come on, Morty!
Fight that stupid worm thing!

230
00:09:25,396 --> 00:09:26,490
We love you!

231
00:09:26,538 --> 00:09:27,761
We love you so much!

232
00:09:27,809 --> 00:09:29,740
Yes, Morty, come on,
you're doing it!

233
00:09:29,967 --> 00:09:32,162
You're doing it!
You're doing it!

234
00:09:34,062 --> 00:09:35,506
Should we pull it out?

235
00:09:35,623 --> 00:09:38,052
No, don't touch it.
Just keep loving Morty!

236
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,256
We still love you.

237
00:09:40,445 --> 00:09:42,200
But I do have
a thing at 6:00.

238
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,903
Oh, God, do I have
to keep looking?

239
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:46,037
Geez, Morty, come on,
pinch it off already!

240
00:09:48,476 --> 00:09:51,244
Don't! Oh, God, sorry, Morty,
I love you!

241
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:54,006
God, is there going
to be an intermission?

242
00:09:54,054 --> 00:09:56,858
Excuse me, but I ordered
the large evil space worm.

243
00:09:56,906 --> 00:09:58,506
I know, it's like,
is that a demon slug

244
00:09:58,582 --> 00:10:00,514
in your stomach,
or are you just happy to...

245
00:10:01,131 --> 00:10:02,162
Sorry!

246
00:10:02,927 --> 00:10:05,326
Well, I guess it's nice to know
the whole family sucks!

247
00:10:05,412 --> 00:10:06,792
So if the blues ones
are my fault,

248
00:10:06,849 --> 00:10:09,357
and the purple ones are my
family's, what are the red ones?

249
00:10:09,412 --> 00:10:11,218
Yeah, d-don't read
into it, Morty!

250
00:10:13,454 --> 00:10:14,643
Ahh.

251
00:10:14,707 --> 00:10:17,312
We need to find shelter
before the sunset, Morty.

252
00:10:17,362 --> 00:10:19,914
Venzenulon Nine has a night
temperature of 300 below!

253
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:22,133
We'll freeze, Morty!
W-We'll be dead in seconds!

254
00:10:22,181 --> 00:10:24,358
I... I think I saw
a cave over there.

255
00:10:24,406 --> 00:10:25,649
You've seen
too many movies, Morty.

256
00:10:25,696 --> 00:10:28,515
A cave isn't gonna cut it.
We're gonna have to use Beebo.

257
00:10:28,571 --> 00:10:30,716
Beebo led us to water!
He's our friend!

258
00:10:30,773 --> 00:10:33,039
- He won't even feel it!
- Oh, no, no!

259
00:10:36,265 --> 00:10:38,015
You wanna die, Morty?
Get in Beebo!

260
00:10:38,163 --> 00:10:40,695
Oh, no, no!

261
00:10:40,831 --> 00:10:42,703
Brace for the ice limit.

262
00:10:43,165 --> 00:10:45,677
Here it comes!

263
00:10:48,998 --> 00:10:52,123
Wait, are we on Venzenulon Nine
or Venzenulon Seven?

264
00:10:53,147 --> 00:10:55,841
Wait a minute, why would I ask
for that to be removed?

265
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:57,797
Are the red ones stuff
you wanted removed?

266
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:00,358
Ooh, that's clever, Morty, but I
don't use color to sort things

267
00:11:00,406 --> 00:11:02,515
because I'm not a mouse in
a European children's book.

268
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:04,420
Then why are all those
pink ones by the liquor?

269
00:11:04,468 --> 00:11:05,924
Liquor?

270
00:11:13,661 --> 00:11:15,795
That was close.
We lost Captain Sky.

271
00:11:15,852 --> 00:11:17,508
He gave his life
for the uprising.

272
00:11:17,565 --> 00:11:19,632
Yeah. It really makes
you think, huh, Morty?

273
00:11:19,689 --> 00:11:21,413
We should never take
things for granite.

274
00:11:21,461 --> 00:11:23,382
- What?
- I'm just saying, life's short.

275
00:11:23,444 --> 00:11:24,847
We shouldn't take things
for granite.

276
00:11:24,894 --> 00:11:26,733
- Are you saying "granite"?
- Well, yeah.

277
00:11:26,781 --> 00:11:28,710
It's "granted,"
with a "D."

278
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:31,711
Take things for granted.
Did you actually think it was...

279
00:11:31,768 --> 00:11:33,491
Jesus Christ, Rick,

280
00:11:33,553 --> 00:11:35,686
what are you, a boulder...
A rock person?

281
00:11:35,749 --> 00:11:37,366
How long have you been saying
that wrong?

282
00:11:37,414 --> 00:11:38,460
Oh, you like that, huh?

283
00:11:38,508 --> 00:11:40,615
I b-b-bet that really
blows your mind.

284
00:11:40,663 --> 00:11:41,859
I mean, yeah,
it's kind of great.

285
00:11:41,906 --> 00:11:44,252
- You want me to erase it?
- What, you can do that?

286
00:11:44,359 --> 00:11:46,849
Ah,.

287
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,772
I knew it,
you piece of!

288
00:11:48,828 --> 00:11:51,210
- You... You...
- You're a asshole, Rick!

289
00:11:51,258 --> 00:11:53,208
Take it easy, Morty, come on.
Just relax.

290
00:11:53,256 --> 00:11:54,825
No, I'm not gonna relax!
Come here!

291
00:11:54,873 --> 00:11:55,873
Let go of me, you little bitch!

292
00:11:55,921 --> 00:11:58,045
I'm gonna grab you by the
scruff of your... Take that!

293
00:11:58,184 --> 00:11:59,397
Ohh!

294
00:11:59,804 --> 00:12:01,448
- Umm.
- Umm. Uhh.

295
00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:03,248
- What...
- What's going on?

296
00:12:03,296 --> 00:12:04,443
- Where am I?
- Who are we?

297
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,500
Who am I?

298
00:12:05,553 --> 00:12:07,843
I think I'm an adolescent boy.

299
00:12:07,952 --> 00:12:09,860
Huh, and I'm an elderly man.

300
00:12:09,917 --> 00:12:14,353
And we appear to be in some kind
of secret confined space.

301
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,775
Yeah, umm...

302
00:12:15,823 --> 00:12:17,108
Don't look at me like that.

303
00:12:17,156 --> 00:12:19,350
For all we know, you could be
the weirdo.

304
00:12:21,329 --> 00:12:23,005
Huh, these things are
obviously storage units,

305
00:12:23,052 --> 00:12:24,850
and since we can't remember
what went wrong,

306
00:12:24,898 --> 00:12:27,710
my guess is that the technology
involves memory,

307
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:30,257
and that this thing on your head
is designed to...

308
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:32,683
Tell us the code, Jagoff!

309
00:12:34,342 --> 00:12:35,720
It's pointless.
He's stonewalling.

310
00:12:35,777 --> 00:12:37,822
Rick, if we don't unlock those
vaccines, Earth dies!

311
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:40,078
You know, it might be time to
step up your interrogation!

312
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,586
Not sure what
you're implying, Morty,

313
00:12:41,634 --> 00:12:43,227
but some lines I don't cross.

314
00:12:43,275 --> 00:12:45,108
Yeah, well,
I crossed every line I had

315
00:12:45,171 --> 00:12:47,483
when this bastard
tried to kill Jessica!

316
00:12:49,624 --> 00:12:53,292
Okay, see those two fleshy sacs
under his chin, Morty?

317
00:12:53,461 --> 00:12:54,834
Grab 'em.

318
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:57,209
You remember the codes now?

319
00:12:57,353 --> 00:12:58,676
Twist!

320
00:13:00,001 --> 00:13:02,668
Give us the codes, man!
Twist harder, Morty!

321
00:13:02,725 --> 00:13:03,842
Harder!

322
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,851
Okay, let go, let go,
let him breathe.

323
00:13:08,543 --> 00:13:09,854
He wants to make a deal.

324
00:13:09,911 --> 00:13:12,011
Half the codes now,
half after you finish.

325
00:13:12,068 --> 00:13:14,111
But can we trust...
Wait, what?

326
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:15,220
F-Finish what?

327
00:13:15,268 --> 00:13:16,259
Y-You know...

328
00:13:16,307 --> 00:13:17,961
I thought I was torturing him!

329
00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:19,292
Oh, and this disappoints you?

330
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,008
Do I tell him we don't
have a deal, Morty?

331
00:13:21,056 --> 00:13:22,438
Because if we can
kill our enemies,

332
00:13:22,486 --> 00:13:25,352
but we can't jack them off, then
how are we better than them?

333
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,757
Well, what did you find out?

334
00:13:27,805 --> 00:13:29,126
We're partners, I guess,

335
00:13:29,174 --> 00:13:31,735
and we fight aliens,
like "Men in Black"?

336
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,570
"Men in Black,"
"Men in Black."

337
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,126
I have "Men in Black 2" in here.

338
00:13:35,174 --> 00:13:36,673
So... So you get
the general idea.

339
00:13:36,721 --> 00:13:38,071
Not quite.

340
00:13:38,119 --> 00:13:40,153
It's basically an endless string
of callbacks to...

341
00:13:40,201 --> 00:13:43,347
All right, save it for Youtube.
I'll keep looking for clues.

342
00:13:47,447 --> 00:13:48,492
What are you doing?

343
00:13:48,549 --> 00:13:49,916
You want your shelf
level or not?

the bubble, Morty.

347
00:13:55,611 --> 00:13:57,360
I also dabble in precision,

348
00:13:57,408 --> 00:13:59,465
and if you think
you can even approach it

349
00:13:59,513 --> 00:14:01,507
with your sad, naked,
caveman eyeball

350
00:14:01,555 --> 00:14:04,147

you're the reason this species

351
00:14:04,195 --> 00:14:05,641
is a failure,
and it makes me angry!

352

353

put up a shelf.

354
00:14:08,609 --> 00:14:10,610

true level?

355
00:14:10,827 --> 00:14:13,606

- Y-yes.

360

361

What's his deal?

364
00:14:47,863 --> 00:14:49,619
- Can't live like this!
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, Morty, Morty, Morty.

365
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:51,619
Go to school, Summer.
I'll go in Morty's memory

366
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:52,942
and do a little...

367
00:14:52,989 --> 00:14:55,301
Lambs to the cosmic slaughter!

368
00:14:55,573 --> 00:14:56,590
Well?

369
00:14:56,638 --> 00:14:59,785

of what I get to remember.

370
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:00,871
Why?

371
00:15:00,926 --> 00:15:02,471
Good question.

372
00:15:03,389 --> 00:15:05,803
Morty, I need darkness to prime
these optical inductors.

373
00:15:05,975 --> 00:15:08,194
Hit the leftmost light switch
by the door for me.

374
00:15:08,251 --> 00:15:09,295
The left.

375
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,147
Okay, lights on.

376
00:15:19,608 --> 00:15:22,475
So, did I just hear three
distinct light switch clicks?

377
00:15:22,527 --> 00:15:23,920
W-W-What do you mean?

378
00:15:23,968 --> 00:15:26,139
I feel like the three sounds
I heard could be explained

379
00:15:26,187 --> 00:15:29,131
by an initial erroneous flipping
of a switch on the right

380
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,459
followed by a hasty,
corrective flipping

381
00:15:31,507 --> 00:15:33,030
of the requested switch.

382
00:15:33,087 --> 00:15:35,354
Then during the resultant
darkness and silence, a third,

383
00:15:35,411 --> 00:15:38,324
shameful unflipping of
the initially flipped switch.

384
00:15:38,381 --> 00:15:40,004
Is my assessment accurate?

385
00:15:40,061 --> 00:15:43,362
Yeah, that's... that's basically
how... how it all shaked out.

386
00:15:43,419 --> 00:15:44,542
I'm sorry.

387
00:15:44,599 --> 00:15:46,832
Ugh.
All right, come on.

388
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:49,768
- What?!
- Come on!

389
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,801
Grab a shovel.

390
00:16:04,849 --> 00:16:05,925
W-What is...

391
00:16:05,973 --> 00:16:08,230

392

393
00:16:14,347 --> 00:16:16,769

zip tie anywhere!

405

than predicted.

406

We'll have to re-destabilize
their economy,

refocus labor class outrage
from upper to middle,

foster a coup, and install
a compliant regime.

- Yes, but you can double time it.
