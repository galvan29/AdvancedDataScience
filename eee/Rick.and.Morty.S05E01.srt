1
00:00:06,615 --> 00:00:08,660
C'mon, Rick.
We're -- We're almost there.

2
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:10,836
Ugh, leave me, Morty.
It's the only way.

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,795
Wha-- Were --
Wha-- Were we --

4
00:00:12,838 --> 00:00:14,275
Were we Blades
in that one?

5
00:00:14,318 --> 00:00:15,493
That's fucking tight.

6
00:00:15,537 --> 00:00:17,191
Just stay with me.

7
00:00:17,234 --> 00:00:18,975
I'm -- I'm scared,
Morty.

8
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,107
I can see the end.

9
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,891
I'm a silly man.

10
00:00:21,934 --> 00:00:23,284
I'm a silly small man.

11
00:00:23,327 --> 00:00:24,807
I'm -- I'm sorry
I got you into this.

12
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,679
Then how about
I get us outta this?

13
00:00:40,692 --> 00:00:42,172
Hello? <i>Hey, Jessica.</i>

14
00:00:42,216 --> 00:00:43,565
<i>I-It's Morty.
From school.</i>

15
00:00:43,608 --> 00:00:45,219
Oh, hey, Morty.
What's up?

16
00:00:45,262 --> 00:00:47,003
Um, I just want to say
that you're really great.

17
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,136
I know the timing never really
worked out with us,

18
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:51,486
but you're really great and
I wish I got to know you better.

19
00:00:51,529 --> 00:00:53,314
Oh, I mean --
That's a lot.

20
00:00:53,357 --> 00:00:54,837
Oh, uh, yeah, sorry,
I guess I just --

21
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,144
No, I just wish
you said it sooner.

22
00:00:57,187 --> 00:00:58,754
-Wh-What?
-Yeah, I mean,
being nervous

23
00:00:58,797 --> 00:01:00,582
is sort of selfish
sometimes, y'know?

24
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:02,671
-<i>Life support systems failing.
-Yeah,
that's a great point.</i>

25
00:01:02,714 --> 00:01:04,325
Well, what are you
doing tonight?

26
00:01:04,368 --> 00:01:05,848
<i>Tonight?
Yeah.</i>

27
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:07,415
Do you, like, want to watch
a movie or something?

28
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:09,547
Um, yeah. Tonight.
Sounds great.

29
00:01:09,591 --> 00:01:11,201
Holy shit.
Holy shit.

30
00:01:11,245 --> 00:01:13,073
Come on, come on!

31
00:01:19,383 --> 00:01:21,385
Oh.

32
00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:23,257
-Where are we?
-We're home, Rick.

33
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,736
I-I landed us
in the ocean.

34
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,869
The ocean?!
The ocean on Earth?!

35
00:01:26,912 --> 00:01:28,740
-Uh, yeah, I-I guess so.
-Oh, shit.

36
00:01:28,784 --> 00:01:30,046
Holy shit.
We have to go.

37
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,526
We have to go
right fucking now.

38
00:01:31,569 --> 00:01:32,875
-What?
-You touched the ocean,
Morty.

39
00:01:32,918 --> 00:01:34,703
What's the big --Oh, fuck. Shit.

40
00:01:34,746 --> 00:01:35,921
What?
Shit.

41
00:01:35,965 --> 00:01:37,880
Richard!

42
00:01:37,923 --> 00:01:40,578
You have desecrated
the sacred treaty

43
00:01:40,622 --> 00:01:42,189
betwixt land
and sea.

44
00:01:42,232 --> 00:01:45,888
Now face the wrath
of your once and eternal foe --

45
00:01:45,931 --> 00:01:47,237
Mr. Nimbus!

46
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:49,109
Sorry.
Who is that?

47
00:01:49,152 --> 00:01:50,762
My nemesis.

48
00:01:50,806 --> 00:01:52,764
-What?
-My fucking nemesis,
okay?

49
00:01:52,808 --> 00:01:54,244
Okay, but what was
his name again?

50
00:01:54,288 --> 00:01:56,246
I am Mr. Nimbus!

51
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,074
He's gonna
say that a lot.

52
00:02:29,801 --> 00:02:31,629
W-Wait, so who is
coming over again?

53
00:02:31,673 --> 00:02:33,805
-He said his nemesis?
-Rick has a nemesis?

54
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:35,242
-I guess.
-Has hementioned him before?

55
00:02:35,285 --> 00:02:37,766
I-I was gonna ask you.
First I'm hearing it.

56
00:02:37,809 --> 00:02:39,420
Who is he?
Like a magic guy?

57
00:02:39,463 --> 00:02:41,030
Rick's science
and he's magic?

58
00:02:41,073 --> 00:02:42,640
He's like a-a fish?

59
00:02:42,684 --> 00:02:44,816
-A fish.
-He's not a fish.
He's Mr. Nimbus.

60
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,471
He's king of the ocean
and he's a piece of shit.

61
00:02:47,515 --> 00:02:48,777
Are you happy, Morty?

62
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,300
Are you happy you
touched the ocean?

63
00:02:50,344 --> 00:02:51,519
He's gonna be here
any minute.

64
00:02:51,562 --> 00:02:53,129
Just help me
smooth this over

65
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,870
or this guy's gonna become
more trouble than he's worth.

66
00:02:54,913 --> 00:02:56,959
Um, hey, I don't know how much
I can help out tonight, Rick.

67
00:02:57,002 --> 00:02:58,439
Jessica's coming over
j-just to, like,

68
00:02:58,482 --> 00:02:59,657
watch a movie
or something,

69
00:02:59,701 --> 00:03:01,224
but y'know,
t-t-that's a good step.

70
00:03:01,268 --> 00:03:02,791
That's a solid step
to something, y'know?

71
00:03:02,834 --> 00:03:04,967
Truly nobody cares
about your dick, Morty.

72
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,447
The sooner you learn that,
the better.

73
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,709
I think you just don't
want me happy

74
00:03:07,752 --> 00:03:09,232
'cause then I'll stop
doing your crazy chores.

75
00:03:09,276 --> 00:03:10,668
Trust me,
after that ocean fuck-up,

76
00:03:10,712 --> 00:03:12,322
you don't get
to do anything crazy.

77
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:13,628
While I bullshit
my way

78
00:03:13,671 --> 00:03:14,890
through this peace summit treaty
with Nimbus,

79
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:17,022
Summer is gonna dive
into the Marianas Trench

80
00:03:17,066 --> 00:03:18,502
to recover
the forbidden shell

81
00:03:18,546 --> 00:03:19,721
that gives him
his power

82
00:03:19,764 --> 00:03:21,636
because Summer
can be trusted.

83
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:22,985
Let's lick tits.

84
00:03:23,028 --> 00:03:24,639
-Okay, what?
-I don't love that.

85
00:03:24,682 --> 00:03:25,857
Of course you don't,

86
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:27,163
'cause you guys
aren't getting any.

87
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,078
Actually,
your father and I

88
00:03:29,121 --> 00:03:30,993
have been very
sex-positive lately.

89
00:03:31,036 --> 00:03:33,691
-Eww.
-Dr. Wong suggested
we experiment.

90
00:03:33,735 --> 00:03:35,998
We've been watching pornography.
Together.

91
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,695
-Gross!
-I might never come back
from the ocean.

92
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:39,306
Oh, you'll have to
tone it down, babe.

93
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:41,656
The squares
can't handle it.

94
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:43,658
There are suicide capsules
in all of your teeth.

95
00:03:43,701 --> 00:03:44,876
Do what you want
with that.

96
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,182
C'mon, Morty.
You're on booze duty.

97
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,184
Okay, Nimbus only drinks
the good shit.

98
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,708
So just toss this
whale-ass ocean-wine in here

99
00:03:50,752 --> 00:03:52,014
and age it up
a few centuries.

100
00:03:52,057 --> 00:03:53,494
So time moves faster
in there?

101
00:03:53,537 --> 00:03:55,017
I-I-Is it like
a Narnia thing?

102
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,672
I'm not a beaver who believes
in Jesus Christ, Morty.

103
00:03:57,715 --> 00:03:59,500
But yeah, it's pretty much
a Narnia thing.

104
00:03:59,543 --> 00:04:02,242
Okay,
but Jessica --All you have to do
is bring wine, Morty.

105
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:04,331
When do I ask you
-for anything?
-When do you --

106
00:04:04,374 --> 00:04:06,724
I haven't been to
a full week of school in years!

107
00:04:06,768 --> 00:04:08,683
I don't know shit!
And for what?

108
00:04:08,726 --> 00:04:09,945
How many enemies
do you have to have?

109
00:04:09,988 --> 00:04:11,251
Why is everything a fight
with you?

110
00:04:11,294 --> 00:04:12,730
You might want to
learn this early, Morty.

111
00:04:12,774 --> 00:04:14,689
-Life is a fight.
-With Mr. Nimbus?

112
00:04:14,732 --> 00:04:15,951
Are you
makin' fun of me?

113
00:04:15,994 --> 00:04:17,692
Mr. Nimbus is
an ice-cold dick killer, Morty.

114
00:04:19,084 --> 00:04:21,652
Okay, let's go.
That's his magic ocean horn.

115
00:04:28,442 --> 00:04:29,747
Is that Mr. Nimbus?

116
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,271
Nimbus.
Richard.

117
00:04:31,314 --> 00:04:32,533
You look like ass.

118
00:04:32,576 --> 00:04:33,969
Let's get this
over with.

119
00:04:34,012 --> 00:04:35,579
I'm sorry.
This is the guy?

120
00:04:35,623 --> 00:04:36,928
Jerry.
Hold on.
No.

121
00:04:36,972 --> 00:04:38,234
I've seen you
fuck a planet,

122
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,758
and this is the guy
you're afraid of?

123
00:04:40,802 --> 00:04:42,456
I like this one,
Rick.

124
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:44,371
He is unbroken.
Untamed.

125
00:04:44,414 --> 00:04:47,069
Perhaps he could use
a firmer grip upon his leash.

126
00:04:47,112 --> 00:04:48,549
Okay, that's enough.
I'm calling the police.

127
00:04:48,592 --> 00:04:49,724
-Go ahead.
-Jerry.

128
00:04:49,767 --> 00:04:50,942
I will!
Good.

129
00:04:50,986 --> 00:04:52,901
I control them.
Excuse me?

130
00:04:52,944 --> 00:04:54,598
He controls police,
Jerry.

131
00:04:54,642 --> 00:04:55,947
Right,
that tracks.

132
00:04:55,991 --> 00:04:57,819
In Dumb World.
Police?

133
00:04:57,862 --> 00:05:01,083
A strange horny ocean man
is on my lawn.

134
00:05:01,126 --> 00:05:02,432
Well, I don't see
how that's relevant,

135
00:05:02,476 --> 00:05:03,651
but we're white.

136
00:05:05,435 --> 00:05:07,307
-Freeze! Freeze!
-Freeze! Freeze!

137
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,569
Fight.

138
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:14,096
Fuck.

139
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:16,359
Flee.
Let's get outta here.

140
00:05:17,795 --> 00:05:19,406
-Shall we, Richard?
-Okay,
but how did he --

141
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:22,017
Jesus Christ, Jerry. He's Mr.
Nimbus. He controls the police!

142
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,933
Um, hello?
Am I in the right place?

143
00:05:24,976 --> 00:05:27,283
I just saw a bunch of cops
having sex with each other?

144
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,415
Hi! Jessica! Hi!

145
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:29,764
Yeah, yup, y-you're
in the right spot.

146
00:05:29,807 --> 00:05:31,113
Uh, everyone,
th-this is Jessica.

147
00:05:31,156 --> 00:05:32,593
This is everybody.
Uh, this is --

148
00:05:32,636 --> 00:05:33,811
I am Mr. Nimbus.

149
00:05:33,855 --> 00:05:35,465
Jesus, Nimbus,
just get inside.

150
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:36,771
Morty,
grab the wine.

151
00:05:36,814 --> 00:05:38,773
Yeah, in a minute.
C-C'mon, Jessica.

152
00:05:38,816 --> 00:05:39,991
Stand aside.

153
00:05:40,035 --> 00:05:41,993
Unless you are
worthy of Nimbus.

154
00:05:42,037 --> 00:05:43,995
If that means
what I think it means,

155
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:46,433
I'll have you know,
we watch porn together.

156
00:05:46,476 --> 00:05:47,869
Oh!

157
00:05:47,912 --> 00:05:50,132
Ooh!

158
00:05:50,175 --> 00:05:53,135
Wow, okay! Looks like you guys
just got the nod.

159
00:05:53,178 --> 00:05:54,310
The nod?

160
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,790
Mr. Nimbus
has a sense for these things.

161
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,661
I take it you're
a sex-positive couple?

162
00:05:57,705 --> 00:05:59,620
Oh, yeah.
Very much so.

163
00:05:59,663 --> 00:06:01,012
-We watch porn together.
-Great!

164
00:06:01,056 --> 00:06:02,623
I'll mark you down
as eligible for a threeway.

165
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,189
Here's all the information
you'll need.

166
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:06,975
The king of the ocean wants
to have a threesome with us?

167
00:06:07,018 --> 00:06:08,542
Totally optional.

168
00:06:08,585 --> 00:06:10,718
But a remarkable option to have,
I assure you. Very jealous.

169
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:11,980
There's a form
on the last page

170
00:06:12,023 --> 00:06:13,982
so we know where to send
the gift basket.

171
00:06:14,025 --> 00:06:16,027
So that just happened.

172
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:18,552
You don't sound
upset about it.

173
00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:19,814
Neither do you.

174
00:06:19,857 --> 00:06:22,382
Oh, my God.
Is this happening? To us?

175
00:06:22,425 --> 00:06:25,167
I thought this only happened
in New York or on HBO.

176
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,647
Dr. Wong
hasn't been wrong yet.

177
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:27,996
You're right.

178
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:29,998
This is exactly
what she was talking about.

179
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,174
So, uh, yeah. J-Just make
yourself comfortable.

180
00:06:32,217 --> 00:06:34,176
Y'know, ch-choose a movie or --
or we can watch

181
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:35,699
some interdimensional cable
if you want.

182
00:06:35,743 --> 00:06:37,571
<i>We now return to "Nintendo 69."</i>

183
00:06:37,614 --> 00:06:39,703
<i>Nintendo, oh,
what are you doing to me?</i>

184
00:06:39,747 --> 00:06:41,357
<i>Oh, Nintendo, oh, Nin--</i>

185
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,924
Or we can watch whatever,
y'know.

186
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:44,186
Wh-Whatever you're into.

187
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:46,231
Morty, did I hear
you're getting wine?

188
00:06:46,275 --> 00:06:48,451
Yeah, I gotta get some wine
for Mr. Nimbus.

189
00:06:48,495 --> 00:06:49,670
Got any extra?

190
00:06:49,713 --> 00:06:51,367
Oh.
Uh, yeah.

191
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,891
Yeah, yeah, I'll go get some,
just for you.

192
00:06:53,935 --> 00:06:55,980
Cool.
Hurry back.

193
00:06:59,549 --> 00:07:01,072
Looks like
you could use a hand.

194
00:07:01,116 --> 00:07:03,031
Oh, hey!
Yeah, th-th-that'd be great.

195
00:07:03,074 --> 00:07:05,555
No problem.
Hoovy?
Dinner's ready!

196
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,035
Be right there,
sugar hoof!

197
00:07:07,078 --> 00:07:08,906
Just helping this young man
through a portal

198
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,560
with that
crate full of alcohol

199
00:07:10,604 --> 00:07:13,868
that's been here
for decades.

200
00:07:13,911 --> 00:07:16,218
Hey, thanks, Hoovy.
I-I really appreciate that.

201
00:07:16,261 --> 00:07:18,394
I-I got a girl over,
and I really, really like her.

202
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,788
-I-I'm just nervous.
-Oh, I know that feeling.

203
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,398
When I first started
seeing Bova,

204
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,445
I could only think about all
the ways I was gonna mess it up.

205
00:07:25,488 --> 00:07:28,143
-So what'd you do?
-Oh, I messed it up.

206
00:07:28,186 --> 00:07:30,232
But I found the one
who loves me for that.

207
00:07:30,275 --> 00:07:32,234
Thanks.
I-I really needed to hear that.

208
00:07:32,277 --> 00:07:34,410
Here,
-t-take one of these.
-Oh, you don't have to.

209
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,065
No, I-I want to.
You have a good day, Hoovy.

210
00:07:37,108 --> 00:07:38,936
You have a great time
with that lady up there.

211
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,461
Just relax.
Will do!

212
00:07:44,594 --> 00:07:45,726
Bova?

213
00:07:46,988 --> 00:07:48,903
Why did you leave us,
Father?

214
00:07:48,946 --> 00:07:50,426
Japheth?
When were you born?

215
00:07:51,601 --> 00:07:53,516
I swore to Mother
if I ever met you,

216
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,735
I'd avenge her.

217
00:07:54,778 --> 00:07:56,476
It wasn't my fault.

218
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:57,781
Whose, then?
Whose?!

219
00:07:57,825 --> 00:08:01,437
The boy
from the magic door.

220
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:04,745
Shall we
discuss terms?

221
00:08:04,788 --> 00:08:06,311
Yeah, fine.
Whatever. Terms.

222
00:08:06,355 --> 00:08:09,619
Term number one --
I am King of the Ocean.

223
00:08:09,663 --> 00:08:11,099
The place I shit?
Go ahead.

224
00:08:11,142 --> 00:08:13,449
Term number two --
Stop shitting in the ocean.

225
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,582
No idea
what you're talking about.

226
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,279
Delicious. Another.

227
00:08:17,322 --> 00:08:19,586
Oh, uh, well, I-I was thinking
of using this one for --

228
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:22,676
Morty, just give him the bottle.
God damn.

229
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:23,938
Another!

230
00:08:23,981 --> 00:08:25,766
Morty,
you get the wine?

231
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:27,985
Hey, Jessica.
Um, yeah, sorry.

232
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:29,944
I just -- just going back
to get it.

233
00:08:29,987 --> 00:08:31,511
Oh.
I thought you already went.

234
00:08:31,554 --> 00:08:34,035
I did! I just --
just got a little busy.

235
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:35,819
Going right now,
again!

236
00:08:35,863 --> 00:08:37,125
You go ahead
and fire up that movie!

237
00:08:37,168 --> 00:08:39,475
That's okay.
I'll wait for you.

238
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,086
Holy shit, holy shit,
holy shit, holy shit!

239
00:08:44,654 --> 00:08:46,656
I've been waiting
for you.

240
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,136
Oh, wow.
Hoovy, right?

241
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:49,964
Never say his name!

242
00:08:50,007 --> 00:08:51,792
Jesus Christ!

243
00:08:51,835 --> 00:08:53,794
Why -- Why is every old guy
super jacked?

244
00:08:53,837 --> 00:08:55,230
Sorry!
I'm sorry!

245
00:08:55,273 --> 00:08:57,014
I-I just need the wine!
I'm sorry! Stop it!

246
00:08:57,058 --> 00:08:58,886
Fucking kill you!

247
00:08:58,929 --> 00:09:00,975
Ow!
Okay, screw this!

248
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:05,980
You know what?

249
00:09:06,023 --> 00:09:08,504
You!
Yeah, fuck you,
Hoovy!

250
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,027
Father?

251
00:09:10,071 --> 00:09:12,639
It's him!
-I told you he'd come back!
-Holy shit.

252
00:09:12,682 --> 00:09:15,642
Okay, look, he wasn't old
like 10 seconds ago.

253
00:09:15,685 --> 00:09:18,383
Ow! Mother fucker!

254
00:09:19,776 --> 00:09:22,649
I'm sorry, Father.
I'm sorry we never believed.

255
00:09:22,692 --> 00:09:24,694
He'll come back.

256
00:09:24,738 --> 00:09:27,392
Stop him.

257
00:09:37,446 --> 00:09:39,535
Papa,
why do we guard the gate?

258
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,930
Because one day,
the dark child shall return.

259
00:09:42,973 --> 00:09:45,585
And we will be ready.

260
00:09:48,065 --> 00:09:49,284
Delicious.

261
00:09:49,327 --> 00:09:51,373
Where is your wine boy, Richard?
I thirst.

262
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:54,724
He's getting it.
Stop eating beignets like that.

263
00:09:54,768 --> 00:09:56,944
Participant voids
all liability

264
00:09:56,987 --> 00:09:59,207
in the event
of death by orgasm?

265
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,209
Are we really ready
to open things this wide?

266
00:10:01,252 --> 00:10:02,427
What if
it gets weird?

267
00:10:02,471 --> 00:10:03,907
What if
I fall in love with him?

268
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:05,866
No, no, no, no, no.
Damn it!

269
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:07,084
What was that?

270
00:10:07,128 --> 00:10:08,738
Another scheme of yours,
Richard?

271
00:10:08,782 --> 00:10:10,261
I know you're
planning something.

272
00:10:10,305 --> 00:10:13,134
It's nothing.
Will you excuse me, please?

273
00:10:13,177 --> 00:10:14,744
What the fuck is going on?
Where's the wine?

274
00:10:14,788 --> 00:10:16,398
Dad was horny
and I dropped it.

275
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:17,878
God, I can't -- I can't believe
you're fucking this up.

276
00:10:17,921 --> 00:10:20,097
I'm not fucking it up! There was
a guy in the thing and --

277
00:10:20,141 --> 00:10:21,708
There's always a guy
in a thing!

278
00:10:21,751 --> 00:10:25,886
Land dwellers do not
keep Nimbus waiting and live.

279
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:27,452
Be right out!
Goddammit.

280
00:10:27,496 --> 00:10:29,063
Do you see this whisper kitchen
"Frasier" bullshit

281
00:10:29,106 --> 00:10:30,934
you're making me do?
Morty, just get the wine.

282
00:10:30,978 --> 00:10:32,936
Beth and Jerry,
stop trying to fuck Nimbus.

283
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,069
Well,
-we wouldn't do it here.
-I'll have you know
he propositioned us.

284
00:10:35,112 --> 00:10:37,114
He propositions everybody!

285
00:10:37,158 --> 00:10:38,420
Hey, hey, hey,
Jessica.

286
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,117
-W-What's up?
-Seems like you're busy.

287
00:10:40,161 --> 00:10:41,597
No, no, no!
I ran into a little trouble.

288
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,468
But -- But -- But I'll go get
that wine right now.

289
00:10:43,512 --> 00:10:45,993
But you said were going to
get it like twice already.

290
00:10:46,036 --> 00:10:49,257
I-I-I was
and I-I'm getting it right now.

291
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,651
Holy shit, it's him!

292
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,786
God damn it!
What do you want me to say?!

293
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,614
I-I'm sorry!

294
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:03,837
We finally beat him.

295
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,665
But let's always
remain vigilant

296
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,188
because you never know.

297
00:11:07,231 --> 00:11:09,103
He might be back
one day.

298
00:11:09,146 --> 00:11:10,713
Okay, Narnia!
Let's go.

299
00:11:10,757 --> 00:11:12,454
Let's fucking go!

300
00:11:12,497 --> 00:11:15,152
It is over.
The boy is not coming back.

301
00:11:15,196 --> 00:11:16,937
He always comes back.

302
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,460
You have wasted
our lives,

303
00:11:18,503 --> 00:11:21,115
our very futures,
on a fantasy!

304
00:11:21,158 --> 00:11:23,465
A lie!
I know what I saw.

305
00:11:23,508 --> 00:11:24,466
You saw nothing!

306
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:26,816
You are
a foolish boy!

307
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,994
Those called fools

308
00:11:31,038 --> 00:11:34,955
are the only ones brave enough
to see the truth.

309
00:11:55,758 --> 00:11:57,673
Tell me, Father.

310
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,153
Am I a fool now?

311
00:12:03,548 --> 00:12:05,202
I was born in the pits
that made these stones.

312
00:12:05,246 --> 00:12:08,205
I lost my years
building a temple to a lie.

313
00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:10,512
So I made lies
my power.

314
00:12:10,555 --> 00:12:12,732
And what is power
but a lie we --

315
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:13,994
Aah!

316
00:12:14,037 --> 00:12:15,212
Oh, shit, he's real!

317
00:12:15,256 --> 00:12:16,997
He's real!
I was wrong!

318
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,347
I was so wrong!
God is real!

319
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,369
Wow.
Impeccable service.

320
00:12:41,412 --> 00:12:43,240
Big tip.
I liked
your other one more.

321
00:12:43,284 --> 00:12:44,851
What was his name?
Kyle?

322
00:12:44,894 --> 00:12:46,026
What?
Nothing.

323
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:47,854
Can we just
sign this thing and go?

324
00:12:47,897 --> 00:12:50,421
Jessica,
-I-I'm so sorry.
-I mean, it's fine.

325
00:12:50,465 --> 00:12:52,859
You were only gone
like a couple minutes.

326
00:12:52,902 --> 00:12:54,034
Morty,
are you okay?

327
00:12:54,077 --> 00:12:55,557
I'm -- I'm sorry,
Jessica.

328
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,646
We just never seem
to get it right, do we?

329
00:12:57,689 --> 00:12:59,256
No, I guess we don't.

330
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,736
But I'm glad
you called me.

331
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,957
Maybe we can start over,
get it right this time.

332
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,046
Yeah.
I'd -- I'd like that.

333
00:13:07,525 --> 00:13:09,049
Thanks for
bringing the wine.

334
00:13:09,092 --> 00:13:10,877
Totally worth it.

335
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,095
Do we need
an opener?

336
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:13,749
Oh.
I'll -- I'll -- I'll go get it.

337
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:14,968
Mmm.

338
00:13:15,011 --> 00:13:17,753
I do so love to sign
upon the dotted line.

339
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,929
Shall we?
Jesus Christ,
yes.

340
00:13:19,973 --> 00:13:21,148
And who
is your witness?

341
00:13:21,191 --> 00:13:22,584
My witness
is the squid.

342
00:13:22,627 --> 00:13:24,455
Really proud of this
SeaWorld theme, aren't you?

343
00:13:24,499 --> 00:13:26,501
Hey, just get a witness, man.
Don't make this about me.

344
00:13:26,544 --> 00:13:28,416
Or perhaps
Richard has no one

345
00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:30,418
with whom
he can trust his life.

346
00:13:30,461 --> 00:13:31,941
Who truly knows him.

347
00:13:31,985 --> 00:13:33,247
Save me.
Fine!

348
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,901
I'll get someone.
Oh, my God.

349
00:13:34,944 --> 00:13:37,425
Morty! C'mere.
I need you for some bullshit.

350
00:13:37,468 --> 00:13:38,905
Look, Rick, I've done
everything you've asked.

351
00:13:38,948 --> 00:13:41,081
Now can I just have some time
with my girlfriend?

352
00:13:41,124 --> 00:13:42,473
Your <i>girlfriend?</i>

353
00:13:42,517 --> 00:13:44,475
I mean, she's not --
we kissed,

354
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,608
but I'm just trying
to take it slow.

355
00:13:46,651 --> 00:13:49,089
You gotta give these things
time to breathe, y'know?

356
00:13:52,483 --> 00:13:54,659
Do you know why
you're special, Adam?

357
00:13:54,703 --> 00:13:56,618
Because I am
-The Traveler?
-Yes.

358
00:13:56,661 --> 00:13:59,273
You will be the one
to pass through the door.

359
00:13:59,316 --> 00:14:01,623
You will be the one
to end our pain.

360
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:04,104
But, Mother,
what about my pain?

361
00:14:04,147 --> 00:14:06,323
Your pain
shall set us free.

362
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:08,325
It is time to begin.

363
00:14:12,155 --> 00:14:14,854
Again.

364
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:16,638
Again!

365
00:14:18,553 --> 00:14:21,686
-You are not ready.
-Please, Mother --

366
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,863
Do you think
he will show you mercy?

367
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:25,560
Like he did to us?

368
00:14:25,603 --> 00:14:27,301
Again!

369
00:14:44,187 --> 00:14:45,319
Does anyone
need anything?

370
00:14:45,362 --> 00:14:47,147
Does Nimbus
need anything?

371
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,409
Holy shit!
Don't judge.

372
00:14:48,452 --> 00:14:50,367
We're growing
-as a couple!
-Aah!

373
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:51,934
Why is this happening
to me?!

374
00:14:51,978 --> 00:14:53,893
For the future!

375
00:14:55,546 --> 00:14:58,723
You dare
assassinate Nimbus?

376
00:14:58,767 --> 00:15:00,203
Sorry. Wait.
Who -- Who is that?

377
00:15:00,247 --> 00:15:01,422
Get in line,
pal!

378
00:15:07,384 --> 00:15:08,864
Such a waste.

379
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,170
M-Mother?

380
00:15:11,998 --> 00:15:13,173
Aah!

381
00:15:14,652 --> 00:15:16,698
Jessica!

382
00:15:16,741 --> 00:15:19,179
You just <i>had
to touch the ocean.</i>

383
00:15:19,222 --> 00:15:20,528
Aaah!
Shut up!

384
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:21,790
There isn't time to --

385
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,227
It's all fucked!
And you fucked it!

386
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:29,363
Huh?

387
00:15:29,406 --> 00:15:30,581
You're early.

388
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,366
W-What is this place?

389
00:15:32,409 --> 00:15:35,021
The end.
But also a beginning.

390
00:15:35,064 --> 00:15:37,110
Isn't every end
a beginning?
Stay back!

391
00:15:37,153 --> 00:15:39,764
I don't want your stripped down
Sundance sci-fi bullshit.

392
00:15:39,808 --> 00:15:41,766
Where's Jessica?
Jessica.

393
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,465
That was her name, wasn't it?
Thank you, Morty.

394
00:15:44,508 --> 00:15:47,468
I had forgotten.
Oh, right.

395
00:15:47,511 --> 00:15:49,905
You'll be needing this.

396
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,733
For the wine.

397
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,956
Oh, shit, we got him!

398
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:59,915
Can you believe he bought
that fucking tree bullshit?

399
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,048
We fucking got him!

400
00:16:02,091 --> 00:16:03,571
Very well.

401
00:16:03,614 --> 00:16:05,921
If you seek war with Atlantis,
you shall have it.

402
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,836
Oh, I've already been to war
with Atlantis

403
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:09,446
when I D-Day'd
that Mermaid Puss!

404
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:10,665
I knew
that was you!

405
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,623
Prepare my exit parade!

406
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:15,278
Say goodbye
to your precious dry land!

407
00:16:15,322 --> 00:16:17,063
For soon it will be wet!
Wet!

408
00:16:17,106 --> 00:16:19,456
Yeah, global warming
is already doing that, asshole.

409
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,111
But sure, yeah, go for it.
Make us slightly more wet!

410
00:16:22,155 --> 00:16:23,634
Am I a joke
to you?

411
00:16:23,678 --> 00:16:24,940
Yes,
you are a fucking joke!

412
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,768
You fucking suck!
You've always sucked!

413
00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:28,639
Y-Y-Y know why
we haven't fought in years?

414
00:16:28,683 --> 00:16:30,076
'Cause you're an embarrassment
to me

415
00:16:30,119 --> 00:16:31,294
and I don't need you
anymore.

416
00:16:31,338 --> 00:16:32,600
I don't need anybody.

417
00:16:32,643 --> 00:16:34,428
All I do is eat ass
and 69 Nintendos, bro.

418
00:16:34,471 --> 00:16:36,038
-Every day.
-Or maybe you hate me

419
00:16:36,082 --> 00:16:38,649
because I am the only man
to see how far you have fallen.

420
00:16:38,693 --> 00:16:41,348
I used to fear you.
Respect you.

421
00:16:41,391 --> 00:16:43,132
Now all that's left
is pity --

422
00:16:43,176 --> 00:16:45,265
for a sad, drunk shell
of a man

423
00:16:45,308 --> 00:16:47,789
too afraid to see
how alone he truly is.

424
00:16:47,832 --> 00:16:50,270
If Diane were alive today,
what would she think --

425
00:16:50,313 --> 00:16:52,837
Don't fucking establish
canonical backstory with
me, you Red Lob--

426
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:55,188
Oh, good.
You're awake.

427
00:16:55,231 --> 00:16:56,624
I just
took some wine!

428
00:16:56,667 --> 00:16:57,886
I said I was sorry.

429
00:16:57,929 --> 00:16:59,366
What the fuck
is wrong with you people?!

430
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:01,107
I have been asking that
for centuries.

431
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:04,327
I was created to study you,
Morty, to know you.

432
00:17:04,371 --> 00:17:05,633
But the closer
I looked,

433
00:17:05,676 --> 00:17:07,809
the more I do not
recognize myself.

434
00:17:07,852 --> 00:17:09,637
Uh, yeah, man, I really don't
have time for --

435
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,466
I have often wondered who
would we be without you, Morty?

436
00:17:12,509 --> 00:17:14,642
Are we anything
beyond our hatred?

437
00:17:14,685 --> 00:17:15,817
And when she came,

438
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,862
I thought
she would be the answer.

439
00:17:17,906 --> 00:17:20,343
Frozen in time.
Forever asleep.

440
00:17:20,387 --> 00:17:21,910
We could not understand
her purpose,

441
00:17:21,953 --> 00:17:23,172
so we hid her away.

442
00:17:23,216 --> 00:17:24,695
Why do we always hide
the truths we fear?

443
00:17:24,739 --> 00:17:26,175
I don't
give a shit, nerd!

444
00:17:26,219 --> 00:17:28,699
Let her go!
Why -- Why did
I clone myself genitals?

445
00:17:28,743 --> 00:17:30,179
Ow!
I don't care, bitch!
Do it!

446
00:17:30,223 --> 00:17:32,007
Ooh! Asshole!
Yeah,
guess I am an asshole!

447
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,530
Y'know, sometimes you gotta be
an asshole!

448
00:17:33,574 --> 00:17:34,836
My grandpa
taught me that!

449
00:17:34,879 --> 00:17:36,838
Okay, okay, okay,
fine!

450
00:17:39,406 --> 00:17:40,711
Morty?
Hey, Jessica.

451
00:17:40,755 --> 00:17:42,713
Wow.
Must've been some nap, huh?

452
00:17:42,757 --> 00:17:45,194
I-Is that ooze or --
I'm not sure what to call it.

453
00:17:45,238 --> 00:17:46,848
It l-l-looks like ooze.

454
00:17:46,891 --> 00:17:49,155
Okay.
W-We can catch up later.

455
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,338
What the --

456
00:17:58,381 --> 00:18:00,340
Rick! Rick!

457
00:18:00,383 --> 00:18:01,689
-...obster motherfucker.
Rick!

458
00:18:01,732 --> 00:18:03,125
Screw this.
What am I even doing?

459
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:05,040
-Help!
-Where are you?

460
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,869
Come back here.
I'm going to make the land wet!

461
00:18:07,912 --> 00:18:09,566
Y'know what,
I'd love to see it.

462
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:11,046
Do it!
God, do anything!

463
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,527
Just don't use me
as an excuse anymore!

464
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,529
Rick!
Wow.

465
00:18:15,572 --> 00:18:17,226
That was intense.

466
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,619
You look stressed.

467
00:18:18,662 --> 00:18:20,751
We signed
-the paperwork.
-I must go.

468
00:18:20,795 --> 00:18:22,188
Well, your people
have our number!

469
00:18:22,231 --> 00:18:23,928
Your starfish mentioned
some kind of basket?

470
00:18:23,972 --> 00:18:25,626
-Jesus, Morty.
-Stop! No, no!
Not today!

471
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:27,889
Can't you go one day
without --You don't get to --

472
00:18:27,932 --> 00:18:29,804
What the --I fucked it up, okay?

473
00:18:29,847 --> 00:18:31,632
It's okay, Morty.
That's what you do.

474
00:18:31,675 --> 00:18:34,069
Now lemme Deus Ex Machina
this shit and let's go home.

475
00:18:35,505 --> 00:18:37,899
God, why does everyone go
Cyber-Punk Bird?

476
00:18:37,942 --> 00:18:39,901
So fuckin' hack.

477
00:18:41,946 --> 00:18:43,122
Oh, shit.

478
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:45,080
Well, that's cool.

479
00:18:51,652 --> 00:18:53,393
Okay, we might be
a little fucked.

480
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,442
Did you think I would
let you die alone, Richard?

481
00:19:12,629 --> 00:19:15,284
I am Mr. Nimbus!

482
00:19:20,028 --> 00:19:21,247
Wow. Phew.

483
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,162
You -- You still got time
for that movie?

484
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:25,468
Yes. Time.

485
00:19:25,512 --> 00:19:27,253
I had nothing
but time.

486
00:19:27,296 --> 00:19:28,950
Endless time.

487
00:19:28,993 --> 00:19:31,126
At first,
it was madness.

488
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,301
Then enlightenment.

489
00:19:32,345 --> 00:19:33,824
Then madness again.

490
00:19:33,868 --> 00:19:36,523
But perhaps
it was a gift.

491
00:19:36,566 --> 00:19:38,525
I could see
the life of time.

492
00:19:38,568 --> 00:19:40,614
And as I watched
the life of time

493
00:19:40,657 --> 00:19:43,225
in all its fleeting,
terrible light,

494
00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:45,227
I wondered,
had I lived?

495
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:47,142
Was I just the object
in another's story?

496
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,971
Was that all I ever was?
Could I be more?

497
00:19:50,014 --> 00:19:53,366
I had nothing but time
and still no answer.

498
00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:55,672
Time without purpose
is a prison.

499
00:19:55,716 --> 00:19:58,284
I have glimpsed into the mind
of eternity.

500
00:19:58,327 --> 00:19:59,676
Perhaps the mind of God.

501
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,984
And found
nothing but silence.

502
00:20:03,027 --> 00:20:05,378
I think we should
just be friends.

503
00:20:05,421 --> 00:20:06,640
Oh, yeah.

504
00:20:06,683 --> 00:20:07,858
I-I-I get that.

505
00:20:07,902 --> 00:20:09,643
Guess we missed
our moment.

506
00:20:09,686 --> 00:20:12,211
Yes.
But there will be more.

507
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:13,473
For both of us.

508
00:20:13,516 --> 00:20:15,214
Goodbye, Morty.

509
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:16,476
Hey,
how's it going?

510
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:18,173
Fuck off!
I'm a Time-god!

511
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,480
Fighting by your side again,
Richard.

512
00:20:20,523 --> 00:20:22,003
It was, uh --Yeah.

513
00:20:22,046 --> 00:20:23,657
Then there is
no treaty.

514
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,180
Because there is
no war.

515
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,399
Aw, Nimbus.

516
00:20:26,442 --> 00:20:27,661
That's --
That's really chill of you, man.

517
00:20:27,704 --> 00:20:28,836
Richard.

518
00:20:28,879 --> 00:20:31,012
Before you were
my greatest enemy,

519
00:20:31,055 --> 00:20:32,709
you were
my only friend.

520
00:20:32,753 --> 00:20:34,189
Grandpa,
-I got the shell!
-Shit.

521
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,583
-Okay, Nimbus, look.
-You son of a bitch!

522
00:20:36,626 --> 00:20:38,062
-Betrayal!
-My weapons, Morty!

523
00:20:38,106 --> 00:20:39,586
I-I-I used them all!
Grandpa!

524
00:20:39,629 --> 00:20:40,848
Wait, Grandpa,
what do I do?

525
00:20:40,891 --> 00:20:42,241
I have the shell.
Should I blow it?

526
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:43,677
Is that -- I'm --
I'm just gonna blow it!

527
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,548
Don't blow it!
Destroy the horn!

528
00:20:45,592 --> 00:20:46,854
What the hell,
Summer?!

529
00:20:46,897 --> 00:20:48,072
You were supposed to
destroy the horn!

530
00:20:48,116 --> 00:20:50,292
How was I
supposed to know that?

531
00:20:52,773 --> 00:20:53,948
Police!

532
00:20:53,991 --> 00:20:56,298
Take this piece of shit
to jail.

533
00:20:56,342 --> 00:20:58,039
I told, ugh, I told you.

534
00:20:58,082 --> 00:21:00,389
He's an ice-cold
dick killer!

535
00:21:00,433 --> 00:21:02,348
Nimbus!

536
00:21:02,391 --> 00:21:03,784
Wait.
So how can he --

537
00:21:03,827 --> 00:21:05,699
Jesus, Summer.
He's Mr. Nimbus.

538
00:21:05,742 --> 00:21:07,353
He controls the police!

539
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,951
Jer, I think
more than one safe word

540
00:21:40,995 --> 00:21:42,388
sort of
defeats the point.

541
00:21:42,431 --> 00:21:43,737
I know,
I just wanna make sure

542
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,652
we have
every opportunity to stop.

543
00:21:45,695 --> 00:21:47,306
Super excited
about it though.

544
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:49,264
Me too, so excited.

545
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,962
Jerry, are we doing this
because we both want this?

546
00:21:52,006 --> 00:21:54,617
Or because it's what we think
the other one wants?

547
00:21:54,661 --> 00:21:56,619
I just wanted to prove
that I love you so much

548
00:21:56,663 --> 00:21:58,273
I would do this
-for you!
-Same!

549
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,666
Let's take that prize
and get out

550
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:01,798
before we make
a huge mistake.

551
00:22:01,842 --> 00:22:04,148
Getting cold feet?

552
00:22:04,192 --> 00:22:05,498
No.

553
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:07,587
-Please don't tell Rick.
-He wouldn't understand.

554
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:10,154
Yes, he would.
