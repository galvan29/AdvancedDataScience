1
00:00:00,571 --> 00:00:02,119
Morty, be sure to pee
before we go.

2
00:00:02,182 --> 00:00:03,626
This adventure is gonna be
a long haul,

3
00:00:03,713 --> 00:00:05,317
and I don't feel like
emptying the jug.

4
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:07,987
Jerry, will you please just let
me automate this **** task?

5
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:09,598
I didn't ask
for anyone's help.

6
00:00:09,686 --> 00:00:11,211
You two
are welcome to leave.

7
00:00:11,299 --> 00:00:12,772
Mom told me she wanted me
to stay here

8
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:13,875
to make sure
you didn't die.

9
00:00:13,962 --> 00:00:16,456
Well, you tell your mother
that I'm gonna be fine.

10
00:00:16,544 --> 00:00:18,203
Don't train your child
to lie, Jerry,

11
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:19,975
even though, you know,
'tis the season.

12
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:20,947
Then I'll tell her.

13
00:00:21,035 --> 00:00:22,901
Whoa!

14
00:00:23,043 --> 00:00:24,774
I told you,
no more rays.

15
00:00:24,862 --> 00:00:26,245
What ray
did you zap me with?

16
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:29,337
I made your atomic matrix
slightly lighter than air,

17
00:00:29,432 --> 00:00:31,646
and now your shoes
are heavier than air,

18
00:00:31,734 --> 00:00:33,299
which makes you
neutrally buoyant,

19
00:00:33,387 --> 00:00:36,183
which I find personally
more impressive conceptually

20
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:38,176
than walking on water,
but what do I know?

21
00:00:38,264 --> 00:00:40,325
I wasn't born into
the god business.

22
00:00:40,413 --> 00:00:41,436
I **** earned it.

23
00:00:41,555 --> 00:00:44,042
Whoa!

24
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:46,353
Just to be clear,
this doesn't mean you helped me.

25
00:00:46,402 --> 00:00:47,688
It wears off in 10 hours,

26
00:00:47,776 --> 00:00:49,626
and the next hit
will cost you 30 bucks.

27
00:00:49,714 --> 00:00:52,177
Like I'll even be using it
in 10 hours.

28
00:00:52,265 --> 00:00:54,236
Siri, set a 9-hour
and 50-minute timer.

29
00:00:54,323 --> 00:00:55,857
<i> Playing The Beatles.</i>

30
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:58,016
- I need to pee.
- Nope.

31
00:00:58,104 --> 00:00:59,748
Here, I've got a centipede
you can swallow

32
00:00:59,836 --> 00:01:00,885
that makes you
not have to go.

33
00:01:00,972 --> 00:01:02,496
I ain't swallowing
no centipede.

34
00:01:02,584 --> 00:01:04,521
What, you think the centipede
wants to eat your pee?

35
00:01:04,608 --> 00:01:06,221
You're not the victim
in this transaction.

36
00:01:06,308 --> 00:01:08,110
Uh-oh, flat tire.

37
00:01:08,198 --> 00:01:10,113
How the hell do you get
a flat tire in space, Rick?

38
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,512
Obviously from a sharp thing
in space, Morty.

39
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,997
It's just crazy
how much it feels

40
00:01:14,085 --> 00:01:15,127
like getting
a regular flat.

41
00:01:15,214 --> 00:01:17,207
Oh, no, no, that's just
my custom-programmed,

42
00:01:17,295 --> 00:01:19,965
fully immersive flat-tire
indication experience.

43
00:01:20,053 --> 00:01:22,118
I-I can turn it off.
I thought it was cooler

44
00:01:22,206 --> 00:01:24,271
than the celebrity voice
package, but here.

45
00:01:24,468 --> 00:01:28,041
<i>Flat tire...
You should be... walkin'.</i>

46
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,372
- Oof.
- Yeah.

47
00:01:29,486 --> 00:01:31,772
- Can I come out with you, Rick?
- No, I've seen this movie.

48
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:33,486
Two guys leave
the ship.

49
00:01:33,574 --> 00:01:34,926
One guy
goes spinning away.

50
00:01:35,014 --> 00:01:36,373
You're staying in here
where it's safe.

51
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:42,829
- Morty, goddamn it.
- Come on.

52
00:01:42,917 --> 00:01:44,326
I n... I never
get to be out here.

53
00:01:44,413 --> 00:01:46,339
Ugh, you young people
think space is like

54
00:01:46,427 --> 00:01:47,666
"Saturday Night Live."

55
00:01:47,754 --> 00:01:50,121
You see it every day,
so you dream of being in it,

56
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:52,467
but it dreams of removing
all the air from your body

57
00:01:52,554 --> 00:01:54,340
and making you float
around it for eternity

58
00:01:54,428 --> 00:01:55,870
as a flash-mummified corpse,

59
00:01:55,957 --> 00:01:59,099
which is also what space wants,
so get back in the car.

60
00:01:59,187 --> 00:02:00,974
I'm not in danger.
There's nothing out here.

61
00:02:01,062 --> 00:02:02,677
Literally everything
is out here,

62
00:02:02,765 --> 00:02:05,121
and unlike everywhere else,
I'm too busy to help you.

63
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:07,688
Right, because you're
always so helpful.

64
00:02:07,972 --> 00:02:09,729
Ah!

65
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:12,885
- God damn it.
- What is that?

66
00:02:12,973 --> 00:02:14,678
Obviously,
it's a space snake.

67
00:02:14,766 --> 00:02:16,298
T-There's snakes
in space?

68
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,754
There's literally everything
in space, Morty!

69
00:02:18,842 --> 00:02:20,646
Now get the ****
back in the car.

70
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,438

72
00:02:53,636 --> 00:02:54,739
I'm dying, Rick.

73
00:02:54,827 --> 00:02:56,978
I can see the black mountain.

74
00:02:57,066 --> 00:02:59,326
People who are really dying
don't keep bring it up.

75
00:02:59,414 --> 00:03:00,639
- Is that true?
- I don't know.

76
00:03:00,727 --> 00:03:02,795
I'm just usually around people
that die faster.

77
00:03:02,892 --> 00:03:04,949
All right. All right.

78
00:03:05,037 --> 00:03:06,720
J-Just let me analyze
the snake's planet,

79
00:03:06,808 --> 00:03:08,387
so I can whip up
an antivenom.

80
00:03:08,475 --> 00:03:10,287
Computer, you might want
to put a rush on this.

81
00:03:10,374 --> 00:03:12,940
Morty's starting to look
like a '90s Japanese ghost.

82
00:03:13,034 --> 00:03:14,531
<i> Cutting corners.</i>

83
00:03:14,619 --> 00:03:17,127
Oof, oh, my God,
these snakes are a mess.

84
00:03:17,215 --> 00:03:19,932
19 billion snakes divided
into 10,000 nations

85
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,253
all on the brink
of global war over...

86
00:03:22,377 --> 00:03:24,000
race.

87
00:03:24,088 --> 00:03:25,159
How funny is that?

88
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:27,154
Imagine being
a racist snake.

89
00:03:27,242 --> 00:03:28,521
"Hey, other snake,
I hate you

90
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:30,388
because you're
the wrong color, snake."

91
00:03:30,547 --> 00:03:33,035
Oh, my God.
You're not laughing?

92
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,336
Oh, you're dying.

93
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:37,076
It's a miracle they were able
to fling one this far out

94
00:03:37,164 --> 00:03:38,874
before they slithered
into extinction.

95
00:03:38,962 --> 00:03:41,411
Oh, oh, God,
I killed their...

96
00:03:41,499 --> 00:03:43,644
What's his name,
their Buzz Aspirin?

97
00:03:43,732 --> 00:03:45,038
It's actually
Buzz Advil, Morty,

98
00:03:45,126 --> 00:03:46,515
and, uh, this is
totally different.

99
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:47,605
It's a female snake.

100
00:03:47,693 --> 00:03:49,193
There's an extra layer
of heartbreak.

101
00:03:49,281 --> 00:03:50,894
Wait. Wait.
Morty, Morty, you hear that?

102
00:03:50,982 --> 00:03:52,459
Listen.

103
00:03:52,742 --> 00:03:54,456
Snake jazz.

104
00:03:54,662 --> 00:03:56,932
Ha. Idiots.
Let's get moving.

105
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:57,926
We've got a long way to go,

106
00:03:58,013 --> 00:03:59,392
and I'm not sharing
that centipede.

107
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,404
Rick, wait.
Go back.

108
00:04:00,492 --> 00:04:03,352
I-I can't be the reason why
19 billion snakes lost all hope.

109
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,377
That's right, Morty.

110
00:04:04,465 --> 00:04:06,133
Only 19 billion snakes
can do that.

111
00:04:06,221 --> 00:04:08,603
That species was never
getting beyond this stage.

112
00:04:08,691 --> 00:04:10,805
To paraphrase
the great Jeff Foxworthy,

113
00:04:10,892 --> 00:04:13,084
if you bite your first contact
on its ankle,

114
00:04:13,172 --> 00:04:15,829
you might be
a type-zero-civilization-neck."

115
00:04:17,698 --> 00:04:19,280
What up, homeys?

116
00:04:19,368 --> 00:04:21,251
Shooting hoops, I see.

117
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:22,769
Hey, who's interested
in a friendly bet

118
00:04:22,856 --> 00:04:24,580
that this white guy
can jump.

119
00:04:24,668 --> 00:04:27,028
Hey, leave the racial stuff
off the court, okay?

120
00:04:27,116 --> 00:04:29,046
Oh, I thought that kind of
talk was part of street ball.

121
00:04:29,133 --> 00:04:31,722
Well, now it's part
of everything else, so chill.

122
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,089
We... We got off
on the wrong foot.

123
00:04:33,176 --> 00:04:35,066
My name is Jerry Smith.
I live in the suburbs.

124
00:04:35,154 --> 00:04:37,117
I'm only here because
I have a certain power

125
00:04:37,205 --> 00:04:39,192
I wanted to kind of celebrate
before it goes away.

126
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:40,859
Yo, we got a Nazi
up here.

127
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,105
Hey, I think there's
a misunderstanding.

128
00:04:43,192 --> 00:04:44,907
Here, just... just watch.

129
00:04:44,994 --> 00:04:46,120
Huh?

130
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,308
Help! Help!

131
00:04:47,396 --> 00:04:49,196
I-I need that shoe!

132
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,585
No, no, don't touch that shoe
or that money.

133
00:04:52,696 --> 00:04:54,896
Let them be a powerful
but confusing monument

134
00:04:54,984 --> 00:04:56,446
to our
neighborhood's integrity.

135
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,321
Oh, boy, what an adventure,
huh?

136
00:04:59,554 --> 00:05:01,690
Hey, Morty, listen.
I can tell you're pretty upset

137
00:05:01,778 --> 00:05:03,184
about the whole
snake encounter thing,

138
00:05:03,271 --> 00:05:04,478
so I'll tell you what.

139
00:05:04,566 --> 00:05:05,657
I'm just gonna go ahead
and avoid you

140
00:05:05,744 --> 00:05:06,634
for the rest of the day.

141
00:05:09,618 --> 00:05:11,400
Play snake jazz.

142
00:05:26,004 --> 00:05:27,448
I-Is this one friendly?

143
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:28,417
It's a snake.

144
00:05:28,504 --> 00:05:30,578
You ever... You ever see
this one look up at the sky

145
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,706
like it's dreaming
of something more?

146
00:05:32,794 --> 00:05:35,934
No, but, uh, all those ones
marked with red sticker, yeah.

147
00:05:36,022 --> 00:05:37,990
Any snake over 50 bucks
yearns for the beyond.

148
00:05:38,078 --> 00:05:39,428
I-I-I've seen them do it.

149
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,554
Ow! Damn it, Slippy,
come on.

150
00:05:45,642 --> 00:05:47,557
Ow!
Just please.

151
00:05:47,682 --> 00:05:49,797
I'm sorry.

152
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,856
<i>Everyone has
a plumbus in their home.</i>

153
00:05:53,906 --> 00:05:56,613
<i>First, they take the dinglepop.</i>

154
00:06:00,873 --> 00:06:03,383
Ow!
**** monster.

155
00:08:01,052 --> 00:08:02,082
Downbeat.

156
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,410
How do you win
this **** game?

157
00:08:03,497 --> 00:08:04,910
We-We've never
gotten that far.

158
00:08:04,998 --> 00:08:07,237
Guys, did I not tell you
to keep your eye on Jerry?

159
00:08:07,325 --> 00:08:08,755
- We did.
- Then where is he?

160
00:08:08,843 --> 00:08:10,225
Maybe he's having
an affair.

161
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:14,949
But for real,
has anyone seen him?

162
00:08:15,065 --> 00:08:16,784
Grandpa, did you trap him
in a painting again?

163
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:17,814
I didn't do shit.

164
00:08:17,902 --> 00:08:20,047
Well,
y-y-you made him floaty.

165
00:08:20,135 --> 00:08:21,390
- Asshole.
- Made him floaty?

166
00:08:21,477 --> 00:08:24,462
I saved his life by making
his body slightly lighter than air,

167
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,163
and it expires
in a couple of hours.

168
00:08:26,251 --> 00:08:28,596
Expires, like he'll fall
out of the sky?

169
00:08:28,684 --> 00:08:30,080
He won't by in the sky,
Beth,

170
00:08:30,168 --> 00:08:33,512
unless it's possible for Jerry
to **** up wearing shoes.

171
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,090
- Oh, crap, he's gonna die.
- What were you thinking?

172
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,680
Hey, babe.

173
00:08:45,767 --> 00:08:47,588
Jerry,
are you in the air?

174
00:08:47,676 --> 00:08:49,191
Rick told me
he made you floaty.

175
00:08:49,307 --> 00:08:51,089
Made me floaty?
Pfft.

176
00:08:51,177 --> 00:08:53,164
Got to love
Rick's world view.

177
00:08:53,473 --> 00:08:55,405
Yes, I had Rick
make me floaty

178
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,789
so I could
put up some lights.

179
00:08:56,901 --> 00:08:57,893
Now, I'm at
the light store.

180
00:08:57,981 --> 00:08:59,562
<i>Get away!</i>

181
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:03,588
Sorry, this lady at the store
is trying to peck me.

182
00:09:03,682 --> 00:09:07,199
<i>Yes, you can help me find
lights after I'm off the phone.</i>

183
00:09:07,287 --> 00:09:09,317
We're in Rick's ship.
How about we just pick you up?

184
00:09:09,404 --> 00:09:10,890
- <i>You're with Rick?</i>
- Well, why wouldn't I...

185
00:09:10,977 --> 00:09:12,509
Jerry, I paused Beth
with a device

186
00:09:12,597 --> 00:09:14,877
Christopher Walken gave me
after a record session.

187
00:09:14,965 --> 00:09:16,220
Real talk, buddy,
where you at?

188
00:09:16,308 --> 00:09:18,016
- Go to hell, Rick.
- <i>Come on, Jerry.</i>

189
00:09:18,104 --> 00:09:19,659
<i>I can recognize
the sound of a seagull.</i>

190
00:09:19,747 --> 00:09:22,050
Can you recognize the sound
of a man's pants

191
00:09:22,137 --> 00:09:23,458
filling up with rain?

192
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,811
I hope to one day.

193
00:09:26,526 --> 00:09:27,521
<i>Jerry,
I'll tell you what.</i>

194
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:29,529
<i>Because it's Christmas,
I'm gonna do you a favor.</i>

195
00:09:29,631 --> 00:09:31,848
I won't let you die,
and I won't tell Beth

196
00:09:31,936 --> 00:09:33,213
that you almost
killed yourself.

197
00:09:33,301 --> 00:09:35,843
- Sounds like a win-win to me.
- <i>Come again?</i>

198
00:09:35,931 --> 00:09:38,266
If I survive,
it'll be without you,

199
00:09:38,353 --> 00:09:40,469
and if I die,
it'll be on your ass.

200
00:09:40,556 --> 00:09:42,471
Merry Christmas, bitch.

201
00:09:42,621 --> 00:09:46,927
I am the Jesus Christ
of Christmas!

202
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:01,094
..I be with him?

203
00:10:01,182 --> 00:10:02,595
We both care.

204
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:05,525
- Whoa. Jerry.
- <i>Yes, honey?</i>

205
00:10:05,613 --> 00:10:06,971
Let us
just come get you.

206
00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:08,546
<i>Beth, I am so touched</i>

207
00:10:08,634 --> 00:10:10,674
that you care for me this much,
but I'm fine,

208
00:10:10,762 --> 00:10:12,367
and I just want to put up these
Christmas lights,

209
00:10:12,454 --> 00:10:14,168
and
I will eat your world.

210
00:10:14,256 --> 00:10:16,593
<i>Honey,
my dad can hear you.</i>

211
00:10:16,681 --> 00:10:17,729
Got to go.

212
00:10:17,927 --> 00:10:19,905
- See you soon.
<i>- Okay.</i>

213
00:10:24,204 --> 00:10:25,584
Well, it sounds like
he's fine.

214
00:10:25,672 --> 00:10:28,359
Yeah, I'm almost kind of
rooting for him this time.

215
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:37,232
One Diet Sprite Remix,
please,

216
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,941
and, uh, is anyone here
an Uber driver?

217
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:41,459
You can't bring
that boulder in here.

218
00:10:41,546 --> 00:10:43,301
- What?
- I said no boulders.

219
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:45,046
- This ain't the lake, buddy.
- <i>Drop the rock.</i>

220
00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:47,194
Well, it's kind of a...
A service boulder.

221
00:10:47,282 --> 00:10:48,752
Yeah,
I float without it.

222
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,724
Big man
holding a big rock,

223
00:10:50,812 --> 00:10:52,097
think you can
take me down?

224
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:54,227
No, obviously not.
You're huge.

225
00:10:54,315 --> 00:10:55,277
- Then put it down.
- Put the boulder down!

226
00:10:55,365 --> 00:10:56,418
- If I put it down,
- Drop it!

227
00:10:56,506 --> 00:10:58,094
- I'm going to float.
- Put it down!

228
00:10:58,182 --> 00:11:00,214
And frankly, your bar
has a lot of ceiling fans.

229
00:11:00,302 --> 00:11:01,416
- You think you're better than us?
- Drop the rock.

230
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,602
- <i>Put it down.</i>
- Okay, okay, okay.

231
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:04,723
Hey, whoa,
what the ****

232
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,391
- Stop doing that.
- I told you this would happen.

233
00:11:06,478 --> 00:11:07,528
Well, stop floating.

234
00:11:07,616 --> 00:11:09,569
- Who said you could float here?
- I can't control it.

235
00:11:12,564 --> 00:11:15,313
Aaaaaaaaaah!

236
00:11:15,451 --> 00:11:17,386
And take your girlfriend
with you.

237
00:11:22,524 --> 00:11:24,760
Summer,
how supes shook am I

238
00:11:24,848 --> 00:11:26,365
about your playlisting
fleekness tonight?

239
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:28,079
You love it?
It's snake jazz.

240
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:30,118
My little brother got bit
by a snake in outer space

241
00:11:30,206 --> 00:11:31,244
and killed it
with a hubcap,

242
00:11:31,332 --> 00:11:32,903
and my grandpa had to scan
its planet's culture

243
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,562
for an antivenom,
and they found this.

244
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,897
It's my jam.

245
00:11:35,985 --> 00:11:39,229
Seriously, my new thing now
is snake jazz.

246
00:11:39,317 --> 00:11:41,185
Can you alter the course
of a species' evolution

247
00:11:41,272 --> 00:11:42,487
like that
without repercussions?

248
00:11:42,574 --> 00:11:43,973
Gee, I don't know,
Nancy.

249
00:11:44,061 --> 00:11:46,237
Can you alter the course
of being a giant **** nerd?

250
00:11:46,325 --> 00:11:47,531
- Sorry.
- Also, later,

251
00:11:47,619 --> 00:11:49,586
we need to discuss
your clothing and your weight.

252
00:11:49,674 --> 00:11:50,859
That's fair.

253
00:11:52,934 --> 00:11:53,936
What the hell?

254
00:11:54,023 --> 00:11:55,411
Target acquired.

255
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,345
Snakes!
Get back in the car!

256
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:06,119
Morty, enough with the...
Snakes!

257
00:12:06,207 --> 00:12:08,041
Target acquired.

258
00:12:09,613 --> 00:12:13,269
Aliens, I am a robot sent back
in time by the Snake Resistance

259
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:14,803
to protect you
from Serpacorp.

260
00:12:14,891 --> 00:12:17,950
My appearance is designed to be
familiar and to put you at ease.

261
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:21,279
The ape child must be eliminated
to protect our timeline.

262
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:22,885
Morty,
what the hell did you do?

263
00:12:23,004 --> 00:12:24,804
I was just trying to do
the right thing.

264
00:12:24,892 --> 00:12:26,156
I took a living snake...

265
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:29,859
Get behind me.

266
00:12:29,947 --> 00:12:31,535
- I will protect...
- Aaah!

267
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,204
Why... Why are they
attacking us?

268
00:12:39,334 --> 00:12:40,593
I-I-I helped them.

269
00:12:40,681 --> 00:12:42,277
You gave them proof that
there was something bigger

270
00:12:42,364 --> 00:12:44,357
and scarier to unite against,
you little idiot.

271
00:12:44,445 --> 00:12:45,952
They would have gone back
into the Dark Ages

272
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,122
for a couple of generations,

273
00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:48,902
but instead,
they dedicated themselves

274
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,192
into making
universe-destroying,

275
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,727
un-thought-out technology
like time travel

276
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:55,330
all so they could try to kill
a little **** sack on Earth

277
00:12:55,417 --> 00:12:56,801
who couldn't let
a dead snake be dead

278
00:12:56,888 --> 00:12:58,811
even after
it bit his ankle.

279
00:12:58,906 --> 00:13:01,210
Next time stay in the **** car.

280
00:13:02,735 --> 00:13:08,051
<i>17 billion snake lives
sended on June 21, 2026.</i>

281
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:12,579
<i>The survivors lived only to
face a new nightmare,</i>

282
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,567
<i>the war between
snake and machine.</i>

283
00:13:16,881 --> 00:13:19,125
<i>In the end,
snake overcame machine</i>

284
00:13:19,213 --> 00:13:20,995
<i>because of what
we couldn't predict...</i>

285
00:13:21,215 --> 00:13:26,528
<i>That an alien, a child from
a distant star, would save us.</i>

286
00:13:40,846 --> 00:13:43,277
W-Where are we going?
W-What are we doing here, Rick?

287
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:44,780
We got to get the heart
of Snake Net.

288
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:46,456
Now, shut up,
and stay close.

289
00:13:46,544 --> 00:13:48,570
Resistance is mouselike.

290
00:13:48,658 --> 00:13:50,889
Whoa, hey, look.
That one's actually really cool.

291
00:13:50,977 --> 00:13:51,995
Come here, little guy.

292
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,822
Ah, you little son of a bitch.

293
00:13:54,036 --> 00:13:55,299
Come on, Morty.

294
00:13:56,911 --> 00:13:59,390
Your brood
must be exterminated.

295
00:13:59,478 --> 00:14:01,616
You will not kill her
or her brood.

296
00:14:01,982 --> 00:14:04,778
- Must kill brood and mother.
- Get behind me.

297
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:06,702
Your brood will seed all life
on this planet.

298
00:14:06,789 --> 00:14:08,904
- That doesn't make sense.
- That didn't make sense.

299
00:14:08,991 --> 00:14:10,481
Hey, it's...
It's Slippy!

300
00:14:10,569 --> 00:14:12,326
Keep up, shit bag.

301
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,452
<i>Hi, you went directly
to voicemail</i>

302
00:14:26,539 --> 00:14:27,811
<i>because your number
is not in my phone.</i>

303
00:14:27,898 --> 00:14:29,012
<i>Don't leave a message.</i>

304
00:14:29,211 --> 00:14:30,519
Hi, honey.

305
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:33,595
Uh, look. Morty told me
that you didn't think

306
00:14:33,682 --> 00:14:36,057
I could hang lights
without killing myself.

307
00:14:36,454 --> 00:14:40,577
Look, I want to be a strong man
for you, but the truth is...

308
00:14:41,951 --> 00:14:45,718
The truth is, I'm coming home
with the best lights ever.

309
00:14:48,696 --> 00:14:49,943
Oof.

310
00:14:50,031 --> 00:14:51,398
Whoa,
feel that turbulence?

311
00:14:51,486 --> 00:14:52,685
Nope, I'm on molly.

312
00:14:54,398 --> 00:14:56,353
- Give me some.
- Ahh.

313
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,622
<i> 10 hours has expired.</i>

314
00:15:01,547 --> 00:15:03,250
Aaaah!

315
00:15:05,528 --> 00:15:07,064
I don't suppose you guys
will take a bribe?

316
00:15:07,151 --> 00:15:08,682
Ah!

317
00:15:12,121 --> 00:15:14,044
Anyone else want legs?

318
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,449
God damn it.
Are you kidding me?

319
00:15:21,537 --> 00:15:23,205
I thought there'd be
a time machine in here.

320
00:15:23,292 --> 00:15:25,327
They're not even a quarter
of the way through making it.

321
00:15:25,414 --> 00:15:26,971
I'm gonna have to invent it
for them.

322
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,515
I-I don't know snake math.

323
00:15:28,603 --> 00:15:30,204
Ugh, I didn't want to have
to do this.

324
00:15:30,373 --> 00:15:31,853
****
All right.

325
00:15:32,191 --> 00:15:33,963
W-What's going on?
What are you doing?

326
00:15:34,051 --> 00:15:37,059
I'm reminding myself to commit
even more to your **** up.

327
00:15:37,275 --> 00:15:38,356
Hey, assholes.

328
00:15:38,444 --> 00:15:40,613
- **** you. Takes one to know one.
- What the heck?

329
00:15:41,015 --> 00:15:43,512
Hey, man, you... you okay?
You know what? **** you.

330
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,734
- What? Screw you.
- Here.

331
00:15:45,821 --> 00:15:47,202
Come on.
Was it really that hard?

332
00:15:47,289 --> 00:15:49,137
What do you think?
Come on, Morty.

333
00:15:49,225 --> 00:15:51,083
Man, I-I-I wonder why
I had a black eye.

334
00:15:51,171 --> 00:15:53,173
Morty, shut the **** up
and put these on.

335
00:16:02,905 --> 00:16:04,543
Okay,
so w-what are we doing?

336
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:05,855
That book has everything
they need

337
00:16:05,942 --> 00:16:07,371
to create
snake time travel,

338
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:10,222
a-and they're getting it
in 1985, snake time.

339
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,805
Now, they're gonna do it so
early that it won't involve us,

340
00:16:12,893 --> 00:16:14,229
and they're gonna be
even stupider with it.

341
00:16:14,316 --> 00:16:15,738
Huh,
a-and then what?

342
00:16:15,826 --> 00:16:17,581
We're removing ourselves
from this sloppy,

343
00:16:17,669 --> 00:16:19,559
**** up story
and letting snake time travel

344
00:16:19,647 --> 00:16:21,229
eat its own tail.

345
00:17:30,281 --> 00:17:32,463
Just have to keep my grip.

346
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,964
Jerry Smith, I am here
to save you.

347
00:17:35,052 --> 00:17:37,522
What? I already told Rick
I don't want help.

348
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:38,714
I do not know Rick.

349
00:17:38,801 --> 00:17:41,152
I was sent by a society
of human-snake hybrids...

350
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,404
- Classic Rick.
- ..from an alternate version...

351
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,081
I did it!
We're landing!

352
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:49,417
I knew I could do it.

353
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,968
Jesus Christ, Rick,
it's pandemonium out there!

354
00:18:02,056 --> 00:18:03,734
T-This is worse
than when we left.

355
00:18:03,906 --> 00:18:05,711
Rick, look, Summer!

356
00:18:09,016 --> 00:18:12,529
Nobody chokes me
without consent.

357
00:18:12,617 --> 00:18:14,537
Y-You just made things worse,
Rick.

358
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,166
Trust me, Morty.
We helped them press

359
00:18:16,254 --> 00:18:17,199
on the gas pedal.

360
00:18:17,287 --> 00:18:19,280
We just got to wait for them
to blow by a cop.

361
00:18:23,787 --> 00:18:25,455
Shleemypants here,
what's up?

362
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,364
Snakes? Time travel?
They did what?

363
00:18:28,451 --> 00:18:31,567
How the **** did...
Okay, okay, I'm on it.

364
00:18:31,654 --> 00:18:35,250
We got a 10-51
on a goddamn snake planet.

365
00:18:35,338 --> 00:18:37,426
Don't look at me.
I'm afraid of snakes.

366
00:18:37,514 --> 00:18:38,840
"I'm afraid of snakes,"
****.

367
00:18:39,264 --> 00:18:40,987
You afraid of work.
That's what you afraid of.

368
00:18:41,074 --> 00:18:41,977
All right.
All right.

369
00:18:42,064 --> 00:18:43,964
Let's go
take care of this.

370
00:18:49,271 --> 00:18:50,686
Oh, look at you.

371
00:18:50,774 --> 00:18:52,285
You a smart snake,
huh?

372
00:18:52,373 --> 00:18:54,160
You using tools now,
huh?

373
00:18:54,295 --> 00:18:55,511
Those tools are gonna
turn into you

374
00:18:55,598 --> 00:18:57,312
manipulating the fabric
of shit.

375
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,991
Get over here, mother**** What
the **** you think you doing?

376
00:18:59,078 --> 00:19:02,664
- Don't **** with time.
- You don't **** with time.

377
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:07,205
- Holy ****
- What happened?

378
00:19:07,293 --> 00:19:09,094
Look, this is better
than them attacking us.

379
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:10,802
Also, that's about
as much curvature

380
00:19:10,897 --> 00:19:12,686
as you're gonna get
from a time-travel story.

381
00:19:12,781 --> 00:19:14,998
You know what? This one counts
as one of your adventures.

382
00:19:15,085 --> 00:19:16,489
Hey, come on.
No freebies.

383
00:19:16,577 --> 00:19:18,595
Aw, man, I-I wanted
to go to Boob World.

384
00:19:18,683 --> 00:19:20,482
Well, now, we can't
because you **** up.

385
00:19:20,598 --> 00:19:22,084
Got to learn a lesson.

386
00:19:22,352 --> 00:19:23,966
You want to go to Boob World,
Summer?

387
00:19:24,054 --> 00:19:25,491
Eh, not today.

388
00:19:25,601 --> 00:19:27,931
This sucks.

389
00:19:28,222 --> 00:19:31,123
Hey, honey, check it out.

390
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:33,161
Jerry,
I was worried about you.

391
00:19:33,248 --> 00:19:35,636
Oh, just killing some snakes
up here like everyone else,

392
00:19:35,724 --> 00:19:37,734
I guess, and finishing
the Christmas lights.

393
00:19:37,822 --> 00:19:40,157
Wait, the whole time?
I was screaming for help,

394
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:41,403
and you stayed on the roof?

395
00:19:41,491 --> 00:19:43,505
I couldn't hear you
over my own screaming.

396
00:19:43,592 --> 00:19:44,676
We've talked about this.

397
00:19:44,764 --> 00:19:46,908
Well,
I'm just glad you're safe.

398
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:49,423
Well, duh,
of course, I'm safe.

399
00:19:49,598 --> 00:19:50,979
Hey, guess what,
asshole.

400
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:52,180
I did it without you.

401
00:19:52,267 --> 00:19:53,774
Whoa! Ah!

402
00:19:54,472 --> 00:19:56,594
Oh, God, it hurts.

403
00:19:56,705 --> 00:19:57,872
Huh! What was that?

404
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,532
I healed your leg 50%.

405
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,558
The rest is on you,
big man.

406
00:20:01,646 --> 00:20:04,484
That's what I'm talking about.
Respect, my brother.

407
00:20:04,612 --> 00:20:06,772
Geez, your dad sucks.
All right, Morty.

408
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,702
Let's go enjoy
a little bit of eggnog, huh?

409
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,665
All right.

410
00:20:09,752 --> 00:20:11,307
Not so fast, boys.

411
00:20:11,395 --> 00:20:13,206
Yeah, I think you might be
forgetting something.

412
00:20:13,293 --> 00:20:15,176
Merry Christmas, **** nuts.
Get to work.

413
00:20:15,265 --> 00:20:16,418
Geez, I don't see
why you have to be

414
00:20:16,505 --> 00:20:18,158
- smug about it. That's not necessary.
- A bunch of ****

415
00:20:18,245 --> 00:20:19,207
This **** sucks.

416
00:20:19,294 --> 00:20:20,942
Yeah, it's fun until it's you,
huh, shit nog?

417
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:23,542
Yeah, have fun sewing those
snake costumes together,

418
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,457
- you little tramp.
- You tell them, Morty.

419
00:20:25,545 --> 00:20:27,302
Geez, you guys don't have
to be dicks about it, all right?

420
00:20:27,389 --> 00:20:29,457
Yeah, neither did the guys
before us, but you know what?

421
00:20:29,544 --> 00:20:30,685
They were.
Merry Christmas,

422
00:20:30,773 --> 00:20:31,996
- you shit bags.
- Yeah, ghost of Christmas

423
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,991
future bitches,
you **** idiots.

424
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:35,897
- So mean.
- Those guys are mean.

425
00:20:36,045 --> 00:20:41,310
<font color=#ffc30f>Sync corrections</font> by <font color=#00FF00>srjanapala</font>

426
00:21:07,838 --> 00:21:09,854
Man, I just want to open
my Christmas presents.

427
00:21:09,942 --> 00:21:12,119
Well, I'm waiting on you
to finish those snake costumes.

428
00:21:12,206 --> 00:21:13,740
I'm almost done.
You know what?

429
00:21:13,844 --> 00:21:15,530
T-They're good enough.
I'm done.

430
00:21:15,618 --> 00:21:17,217
All right.
Let's go.

431
00:21:19,021 --> 00:21:20,501
All right. We're landing.
Come on.

432
00:21:20,589 --> 00:21:22,502
Man, I can't believe
we're almost done, Rick.

433
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,632
I can practically taste
the eggnog.

434
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,799
Hey, you know what?

435
00:21:25,887 --> 00:21:27,920
I... I feel like
we're forgetting something.

436
00:21:28,008 --> 00:21:29,878
Oh, yeah, uh, thanks
for reminding me.

437
00:21:29,973 --> 00:21:32,005
Morty, next time,
stay in the car.

438
00:21:36,114 --> 00:21:37,440
<i>Did you get any of that?</i>
