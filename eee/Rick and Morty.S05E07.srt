1
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,870
All right, Norman. Let's go to work.

2
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,110
Oh, Dr Ellingham...

3
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,670
Oh, can I just say...

4
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,550
I think you made the right decision.

5
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:01,310
About you and Louisa Glasson -
never meant to be.

6
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,870
What's happened to your face?
My face? Nothing.

7
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,910
Oh, unless you mean my new lipstick.

8
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,910
I thought I'd try a different shade.
Right.

9
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,270
And you probably noticed
my hair too. No.

10
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,470
Oh, Dr Ellingham, always teasing me!

11
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,510
(NERVOUS LAUGH)

12
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,430
See you later.

13
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:32,630
When I first opened the sanctuary, I
got maybe one unwanted cat a month.

14
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,830
Now I get two or three a week.
Is that right?

15
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:39,390
Which is why this fundraising
evening is so important to me.

16
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,350
Yeah. You keep saying.

17
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:44,030
So I hope you've bought
plenty of food and drink.

18
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,790
I'll get it when you've paid me.
Paid you?

19
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:49,230
I've told you,
I need the money up front.

20
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:53,550
You said there'd be no cost.
I said the wine would be AT COST.

21
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,790
If you think I'm going to give you
a whole lot of free food and wine,

22
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,550
you're barking up the wrong tree.

23
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,470
Well, I'll have to cancel
the evening.

24
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:03,350
Well, I'm sorry, but times are hard.

25
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,110
They are, if you're a cat!

26
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,950
I don't know how
I'm going to feed the poor things.

27
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,230
I mean, are you quite sure...?

28
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,630
Ow!

29
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,670
Here, Doc, Doc! Hang on.

30
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,150
I need your help. It's Mrs Dingley.

31
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,190
She's come a cropper.

32
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,630
Ohh! Ow!

33
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,670
Shush! It's nothing serious.

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,390
Just put a bag of ice on it.

35
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,190
Do you have any ice?
Some.

36
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,990
Not a lot.

37
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,030
Could you fetch it, please?

38
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,550
If the pain gets any worse,
come and see me in the surgery.

39
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,910
Oh, right.

40
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,190
Oh, Doctor.
Do you think I could ask...?

41
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,310
If you pester me for a donation,
the answer's still no.

42
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,990
Well, you can't blame me for trying.
Yes, I can.

43
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:53,110
Miserable bugger.
I heard that.

44
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,310
So you'll go to Clappy-Time
at the library? Yeah, maybe.

45
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,270
Or Sing-Along-Susie
at the Harbour Cafe.

46
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:05,150
Well, we are spoilt for choice,
aren't we, Jim-Jim?

47
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,990
It's James.
(SCHOOL BELL)

48
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,230
I have to go. You will find
something nice to do, won't you?

49
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,270
Yes, I expect so.

50
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,110
Aw, bye-bye, darling. Be a good boy.

51
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,150
Go!

52
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,710
Hey! Inside!

53
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,310
Looks like you're busy.

54
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,270
But you're going to come in anyway.

55
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,190
Are you here as a patient?
Yes and no.

56
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,350
Are you considering
changing your mind about Louisa?

57
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,190
No.

58
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,590
So, as your doctor,
what can I do for you?

59
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,310
I've run out of Oralube.

60
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,830
You could have telephoned
for a repeat prescription.

61
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,590
I assumed you'd want to see me.

62
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:52,630
My symptoms might have changed,
my condition deteriorated.

63
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:55,590
Has your condition deteriorated?
Not in the least.

64
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,990
So... you're going up to London
as planned,

65
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,510
and Louisa will stay here
with the child?

66
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,430
Yes.

67
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,270
Good.

68
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,910
You parents stayed together
for your sake.

69
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,110
No-one got out unscathed.

70
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,150
We don't want a repeat of that.

71
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,270
Well, this has been fun (!)

72
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,670
If you want to discuss it further,
Martin,

73
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,710
you know where I am.

74
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,510
Thank you.

75
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,590
Hello, there.
We're looking for Bert Large.

76
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,310
He's around somewhere.

77
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,190
OK, we'll sit here
and you can run inside

78
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,230
and fetch him for us, yeah?

79
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,390
What do you want?
Oh, where are my manners?

80
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,790
I'm Alastair Tonken.

81
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,910
And this here is
my little boy Norman.

82
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,710
All right?

83
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,350
You work here, do you?

84
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,310
Off and on.

85
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,630
Oh! There he is.

86
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,670
Hello, Bert. (CHUCKLES)

87
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,070
Lovely to see you again.

88
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,910
You can probably guess
what we're here for, I'm sure.

89
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,710
Can we talk about it somewhere else?

90
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,630
No. Here is quite nice,
thank you, Bert.

91
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,310
All I want to know is -
have you got it? (MOUTHS)

92
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,070
Got what?

93
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,110
What's he on about, Dad?
Dad?

94
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:41,550
Your dad has borrowed Â£1,000.

95
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,270
You what?
Ah, don't worry.

96
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,430
He can probably pay it back.

97
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,550
The only thing is that if he can't,

98
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:52,110
then there might be some of those -
oh, what do you call them?

99
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,590
What is the word I'm looking for?
Repercussions.

100
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:58,030
That's it. Yeah. There might
have to be some repercussions.

101
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,470
You didn't see the sign?
Says you shouldn't

102
00:06:03,471 --> 00:06:05,550
park in the harbour
when the tide's in.

103
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:08,750
If we had seen the sign, we never
would have parked in the harbour.

104
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:11,790
Couldn't get near the car last
night. The water was up to here.

105
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,510
So you just left the vehicle
where it was? No!

106
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:18,750
We drove it away and
we put it back there just now (!)

107
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,630
Of course we left it where it was!
Was anything stolen?

108
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:26,150
No. Somebody smashed the back window
and fiddled with my wife's clothing.

109
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,670
You didn't put your wife's clothing
in the boot?

110
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:31,350
It's just a coat.
Real fur, though.

111
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,390
Fox, not mink.

112
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:37,230
You went to a loan shark?
That's not what he calls himself.

113
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,190
But you know that's what he is.
And if we can't pay him back,

114
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:43,470
there's going to be repercussions.
Come on, that could mean anything.

115
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,510
Exactly. And you saw Norman.

116
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,470
If he wants to smash up the
restaurant, who's going to stop him?

117
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,230
OK, things don't look good
right now.

118
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,870
You told me, Dad,
you said you went to the bank.

119
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,350
I admit I've been economical
with the truth.

120
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:58,110
It's a shame you weren't
economical with anything else

121
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,990
because we're going to go bankrupt!

122
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,270
Well, if you hadn't spent
all that time with Ruth,

123
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,510
instead of helping me here.
So now it's my fault?

124
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,550
I'm not saying that.

125
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,310
I'm just asking you to help me.

126
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,870
No, Dad. You got us into this mess.

127
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,910
You get us out.

128
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,990
Well, thank you very much.

129
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,030
(SEAGULL CALLS)

130
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,310
Are you open?
The door's unlocked.

131
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,790
Most people would take that
as a good indication.

132
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,830
You told me to come and see you
if the pain got worse.

133
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,870
You got any time today?

134
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,790
See the receptionist.

135
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,190
I want to see the doctor.

136
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:52,590
Has he got any time today?

137
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:55,590
Do you want those cuts looking at?
No, I don't.

138
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,630
They're just my cats.

139
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,270
I've actually come about my knee.

140
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:05,230
Do you want to see it?
No. No.

141
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,270
Sit down.

142
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,390
Go on.

(BABY GURGLES)

144
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:20,510
Any chance of a cup of coffee?
We're not open.

145
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,150
I don't think there's a cafe
in this village

146
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,950
that isn't full of kiddies crying

147
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:31,110
or even worse, someone singing
to try and stop the kiddies crying.

148
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:34,990
It's lovely to be somewhere
so peaceful.

149
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,070
Shame about the coffee.

150
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,110
I'm trying to think.

151
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,150
What about?

152
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,310
Well, if you must know...

153
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:50,590
the restaurant's in trouble and I'm
trying to come up with new ideas.

154
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,350
Well, why didn't you say so?

155
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:57,070
I ran a very successful restaurant
in Andalusia for seven years.

156
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,150
I am full of good ideas.

157
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,350
If you fancy a brainstorm...

158
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,270
over a nice cup of coffee.

159
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,310
Black or white?

160
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,190
(BABY WAILS)

161
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,430
I'll be back in five minutes.
You get that percolator on.

162
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:14,350
If you'd elevated your knee,
it wouldn't be this swollen.

163
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,390
By coming to see me
to tell me that it hurt,

164
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,430
you've made it even worse.

165
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,470
Are you going to give me
a lift home?

166
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,790
You can put my bike
on the top of your car.

167
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,830
I'm a doctor, not a taxi driver.

168
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:28,630
Stay off your feet for at least
two days. Stay off my feet?

169
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,190
Who's going to feed
my cats and kittens?

170
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,990
They can't feed themselves.

171
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,710
Get someone to help you, then.

172
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,990
I can't even afford to feed the
animals, let alone pay an assistant.

00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:42,470
Sit down with your leg up as often
as possible with your foot raised.

174
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,490
In the meantime, I'll give you a

175
00:09:44,491 --> 00:09:46,470
prescription for some
anti-inflammatories.

176
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,270
Your glasses have broken.
I know that.

177
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,670
They're my old ones.
Do you have a new pair?

178
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:05,030
Somewhere.
I don't know where they are.

179
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,830
These do the job,
if I want to read something.

180
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:10,070
You should go to the optician
and get some more.

181
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,110
What, and waste all that money?

182
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,150
Give that to Mrs Tishell.

183
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:19,150
Oh... Will she be able
to read your writing?

184
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,230
If she holds it the right way up,
yes.

185

187
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,590
So come on!

(ENGINE FAILS TO START)

190
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:44,030
Have you flooded the carburettor?
Eh?

191
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,830
I've no idea what it means,

192
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,910
but it's what people always ask me
when my car fails to start.

193
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:51,870
You really need to think about
getting this tractor repaired.

194
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,910
And the bowser can't hold its water.
Should I call the vet?

195
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,670
No, the water bowser.
By the time I get to the pasture,

196
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,790
there's nothing left
for the sheep to drink.

197
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,750
That's IF I even get there.

198
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,670
I can probably fix the bowser
myself,

199
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,870
but you should think about getting
a new tractor one of these days.

200
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,590
I don't imagine they come cheap.

201
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:11,470
Well, maybe three or four grand
second-hand.

202
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,510
Let's deal with one thing at a time.

203
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:19,230
For the fencing in the top field,
you needed Â£800.

204
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,460
No, sarge, I have yet to release
the vehicle to the registered keeper.

205
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,020
I want to know what to do with
the big rock in the back of the car.

206
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,060
Might be fingerprints or...

207
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,900
No, I know it only appears
to be criminal damage,

208
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,140
but there are traces of blood
all over the broken window.

209
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,500
Should I take samples for DNA?

210
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,820
Hello?

211
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,380
(SHOP BELL)

212
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,820
For my leg, keep the swelling down.

213
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,180
Yes. Oh, yes, yes. That's what
I would have prescribed myself.

214
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,900
While I'm here,
I want to ask about some glasses.

215
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,220
What about them?
Well, have you got any?

216
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,500
Help me with my reading.
I don't want anything too pricey.

217
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,340
All my spectacles are on the rack
by the door.

218
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,700
I got the message that you were
holding some pessary rings for me.

219
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:35,660
Oh, yes. Yes, Dr Ellingham,
I've got them right here.

220
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,900
Are these for long sight
or short sight?

221
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,060
I was just thinking...

222
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,060
Erm, perhaps we could meet tonight.

223
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,180
For a chat... about everything?

224
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,220
The pessary rings.

225
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,460
How much for these? Oh!

226
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,380
Oh! Ow! Oh, my eye!
Oh, God!

227
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,140
Oh, my eye hurts. It really hurts.
Ohh!

228
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,740
Take your fingers out.
Hold your head still.

229
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:02,180
Tilt your head up. Look up.
What have I done? I've hurt it.

230
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,260
Be still. Hold still.

231
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,260
Have I damaged it?

232
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,140
No, it's just some arcus senilis.

233
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,660
What's that, for heaven's sake?

234
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,780
A cream-coloured circle
around your iris.

235
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,500
It's common in people of your age.

236
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,380
It can be a symptom
of high cholesterol.

237
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,340
Come to the surgery.
I'll do a blood test.

238
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,440
I can't come today.
I've got people coming

239
00:13:20,441 --> 00:13:22,500
over from Delabole to
look at some cats.

240
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,540
If cats are more important than
your health, I couldn't care less.

241
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,180
Or I'm also free tomorrow night.

242
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,020
Just put the pessary rings
on my account, please.

243
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,020
(SHOP BELL)

244
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,820
Thank you very much. Oh, it's you.

245
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,540
How's James Henry?
Fine.

246
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,260
What are you doing in here?
I've come to buy him a dummy.

247
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,140
No. He's not to have a dummy.
Louisa and I have discussed this.

248
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:47,620
I'm sure you've discussed lots of
things, but people change their minds.

249
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,500
No! No dummies.

250
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,380
You're not to sell this woman
a dummy.

251
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,220
Whatever you say, Dr Ellingham.

252
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,780
Do I have your permission to
purchase James Henry some nappies?

253
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,340
Yes, of course.

254
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,380
Hello, Sally.
Hello.

255
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:06,140
Oh. And hello to you, James Henry.

256
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:10,100
Don't you look just gorgeous today?

257
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,660
Yes, you do!

258
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,020
There was blood
all over the vehicle.

259
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,740
I've taken some samples.

260
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:19,580
But I need your help to identify
any possible suspects.

261
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,340
My help?
Mm.

262
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:25,420
Now, I know you can't show me
any medical records

263
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,460
or discuss individual patients,

264
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,940
but if I were to mention a few names

265
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,700
and one of those names
were to coincide

266
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,700
with someone who came in here
for treatment

267
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,820
to cuts or abrasions
to their hands or arms...

268
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,580
Mrs Dingley cut her wrist.
Florence Dingley.

269
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,380
Runs the cat home.

270
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,420
Is that Dingley with a D?

271
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,700
What's going on?
Nothing, Doc.

272
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,740
I was just...

273
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,980
Just...
Telling me off

274
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,820
for dropping litter in the street.

275
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,540
It will never happen again, Officer.

276
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,540
Yes, well...

277
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,540
you see it doesn't.

278
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,580
Otherwise...

279
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,420
Spanish theme night?
Yeah.

280
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,660
We do the place up
like an Andalusian bar.

281
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,740
We serve tapas -
that's little Spanish dishes...

282
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,900
and we keep the sangria flowing
all evening.

283
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:38,140
Just one problem - I can't afford
no tapas nor that sangria.

284
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,420
Well, what's in your freezer?

285
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,940
Right, I'll chop these up small,

286
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,460
fry them in olive oil,

287
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,340
lashings of garlic.

288
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,620
As for the sangria...

289
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,980
we take your cheapest plonk,
add orange juice and cooking brandy

290
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,020
and (SNAPS FINGERS) ole!

291
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:58,100
This looks like rubbish.
Hang on a minute.

292
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,940
That's the new house red, that is.
Perfect.

293
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,380
Right,
I've got to pick up my grandson.

294
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,100
So I'll start on the tapas tomorrow.

295
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,420
Who's got the baby?
A girl called Angie Grappy.

296
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,740
She only wants two quid an hour.

(BABY WAILS)

298
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:27,900
Thursday is Spanish theme night.
No, it's not.

299
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,900
Listen, we ask the Tonkens
for a few more days to pay,

300
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:34,260
and in the meantime, we make a
fortune with this tapas and sangria.

301
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,900
No, you will never make a fortune
selling anything,

302
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,940
whereas I...

303
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,980
have Â£800.

304
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,740
Now I've got a bit in the bank,
there's some cash around the house.

305
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:50,460
We put it all together,
and we might have a grand.

306
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,380
That's great.
Yeah.

307
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,820
But what about the interest?

308
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,260
What? What interest, Dad?

309
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,340
The Tonkens don't lend money
for free.

310
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,380
We've got to find another 100 quid.

311
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,420
Oh, Dad.
Don't worry.

312
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,420
We'll manage.
Yeah, but how?

313
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,860
Out of the way! Out of the way!

314
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,660
What are you doing?

315
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:46,700
800 quid there.
And another 200 quid here.

316
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,580
Quite a lot of loose change,
I'm afraid. Hope you don't mind.

317
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:53,140
Not at all, Bert.
I'm a very reasonable man.

318
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,380
Pleasure doing business.

319
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,820
Not that our business is concluded
just yet.

320
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:01,020
No, I know that we owe you
another 100 quid for interest,

321
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,100
but if we can have
until the end of the week.

322
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,380
You don't owe me 100 quid.
Really?

323
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,420
You owe me 350.
BOTH: What?

324
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:10,300
There's a late-payment penalty
clause.

325
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:14,380
So we're wanting 350 quid
from you two by this time tomorrow.

326
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,740
Six o'clock.
We can't do that.

327
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:20,660
Well, you'll have to, unless
you'd rather face the consequences.

328
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,900
You said there'd be repercussions.

329
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,140
They're very similar
to consequences.

330
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,060
What on earth is it, Norman?
Look.

331
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,380
I think he's bothered
by them marks on your neck.

332
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,900
Are they contagious?
No. Just...

333
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,940
Better wash your hands, Norman.

334
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,900
Martin.
Louisa.

335
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,620
I haven't got long before school.

336
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,660
I brought my notes
on the christening.

337
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:14,460
Some ideas for catering, a guest
list and suggestions for music.

What?

339
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,580
Who's taking care of James Henry?
Well, my mother, of course.

340
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,660
Are you sure about that?
Why are you asking?

341
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,420
Well, I saw... I thought I saw

342
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,540
a girl wheeling James
in his pushchair yesterday.

343
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:30,460
Martin, my mother's looking
after the baby all day today,

344
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,060
just like she looked after him
all day yesterday.

345
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,380
I'm sorry, but I'm late.
Could you have a look at this? Yes.

346
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,580
(WINCES)

347
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,100
You OK?
I feel a bit sick.

348
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,340
I think one of them prawns was off.

349
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:03,380
Shall I chuck 'em?
No, shove them back in the fridge.

350
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,300
Stop scratching.
It's driving me mental, Doc.

351
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,740
Stop it! How long have you had it?

352
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,500
Started itching yesterday.

353
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,580
Changed your washing powder
recently? No.

354
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:18,140
Tried a new aftershave?
You been in close contact

355
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,780
with any domestic animals -
cats, dogs? No.

356
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,100
Are you suffering stress
at the moment?

357
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,500
Well, life with Dad
is always stressful.

358
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,540
Hm. Put your shirt on.

359
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,020
They're hives.
They'll go of their own accord.

360
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:35,580
In the meantime, I'll prescribe you
some ointment to ease the irritation.

361
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:38,260
Hives?
Well, how comes I've got 'em?

362
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,420
What are they?
Circumscribed dermal oedema.

363
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,220
Patches of irritated skin
caused by any number of reasons.

364
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,580
But you say you can rule out stress?

365
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,980
Yes.

366
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,580
Al! I was just on my way to see you.

367
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,700
Well, I'm sort of busy, so...

368
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,540
My son would like a word.

369
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,580
Norman, show him your hand.

370
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,660
It seems Norman has caught
whatever it is you have.

371
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,380
It's only hives.

372
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:13,060
I see you've been to the doctor.
What did he say?

373
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,540
He asked me if I'd changed
my washing powder or my aftershave.

374
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,460
He give you a prescription?
Yeah.

375
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,500
Excellent.

376
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,940
(SHOP BELL)
Oh!

377
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,980
Good morning, Al.

378
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,740
And how are you today?
Been better, Mrs T.

379
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,380
Got this.

380
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,260
Is it hives
or something more serious?

381
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,900
I never discuss
my clients' prescriptions.

382
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,260
But you can tell us
if hives are contagious?

383
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,620
If you want medical advice,
I suggest you ask Dr Ellingham.

384
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,860
What is it about me
that women don't like?

385
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,420
You know that Mrs Dingley,
that cat woman,

386
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,380
she couldn't bear to look at me,
let alone hold a conversation.

387
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:54,620
Were you asking her for money?
I was asking her for MY money.

388
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,500
You leave her alone!

389
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:01,100
This is only for external use.

390
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,900
(PHONE RINGS)
Ooh!

391
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,060
Would you excuse me?

392
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,100
Here we go. Here.

393
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,140
Thank you.

394
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,100
Hello.
Ahem!

395
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:19,100
And thank you in advance for the 350
quid we'll be collecting tonight.

396
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,380
There's no way...
We'll be at that restaurant at 6pm.

397
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,420
You make sure you're there.

398
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,700
(GROANS)

399
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,140
Agh!

400
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:41,100
You look absolutely terrible,
if you don't mind my saying so.

401
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:44,900
I think I'm going to be sick.
It really hurts. Just here.

402
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,940
Should I take those prawns
off the menu?

403
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,700
I think I'm gonna use your loo.

404
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,060
Ugh!

405
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,460
All right, Ange?
No. I'm knackered.

406
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,500
Miss Glasson's mum's too ill
to look after the baby today,

407
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,420
so I've got him again.

408
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:04,580
Any chance I could see the doc?
I'll have to check.

409
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,460
Why have you got my baby?

410
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,500
Eleanor's not very well today.

411
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,300
Did you have him yesterday?
Yeah.

412
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:13,140
But I'm not here to talk about
the baby. It's my ankle tag.

413
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,580
Your what?
My ankle tag.

414
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,060
If I start to sweat,
it gets really sore,

415
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,100
like it's rubbing against the skin.
Can you take a look, Doc?

416
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,700
LOUISA: This is really super.

417
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,820
Carry on, children.
Be back in a moment.

418
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,180
What's wrong?
Why have you got James?

419
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,940
I thought it was better I have him,

420
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,540
rather than leave him
in the custody of a child convict.

421
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:50,260
What? Your mother subcontracted
to a girl called Angie.

422
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,740
Not Angie Grappy?
I don't know what her full name was.

423
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:56,020
No doubt PC Penhale will have it
on his police computer.

424
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,100
Right, OK, I'll deal with it.
Well, will you?

425
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,660
Or just return him to your mother
and hope for the best?

426
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:03,260
You've made your point.
Now will you please go away?

427
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,860
Your mother couldn't care less
about our baby.

428
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,860
Oh, but YOU could (!)
A man who's about to leave his son

429
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,580
and move hundreds of miles away
for the sake of his career?

430
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,620
Oh, yeah, you really care
about our baby.

431
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,540
That is a complete distortion.
No, enough!

432
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,580
I'm in the middle of a lesson.

433
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,300
And what about James Henry?

434
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,820
Not your problem, Martin.

435
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,900
Right. We have a visitor.

436
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,940
CHILDREN: Aw!

437
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:33,300
This lot ought to make a profit,
but I'm not sure it'll be 350 quid.

438
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:36,620
Of course it won't.
Anyway, they want it tonight.

439
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:39,380
So what are we going to do?
We could act like men.

440
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:43,100
How would that work, exactly?
We stand up to the Tonkens.

441
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:46,940
We say,
'No, you can't have your money.

442
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,900
Now, leave us alone.'

443
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:53,300
You want protection? In case
they don't like us acting as men.

444
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:57,380
The son Norman,
if he takes a swing at my dad...

445
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,420
he'll probably kill him.

446
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,180
But you don't know he'll do that.

447
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,900
Just to make sure he don't,
can you come with us?

448
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:06,300
I'm not some kind of bodyguard

449
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:09,580
to be used as and when
you feel you might be in danger.

450
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,620
But you've got nothing better to do.
That's where you're wrong.

451
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,420
I'm in the middle
of an ongoing enquiry

452
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,820
concerning criminal damage
to a motor vehicle.

453
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,260
I'm just waiting
to hear back from the CRB.

454
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,820
That's Criminal Records Bureau.

455
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:24,780
And then I intend
to interrogate the suspect.

456
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,020
Can't it wait?
No.

457
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,740
Anyway, your business
with a loan shark is a civil matter.

458
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:33,340
So I can't get involved.
What do you mean by 'civil matter'?

459
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:36,340
It's not a criminal offence,
if you don't pay back a loan.

460
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,540
Mr Tonken can take you
to a civil court,

461
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,600
but if he's not licensed
with the Office of

462
00:25:40,601 --> 00:25:42,620
Fair Trading, he
probably won't risk it.

463
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,660
So what you're saying,
what you're actually saying, Joe,

464
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,500
is you're not going to help us.

465
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:51,940
I'm saying I can't.
My hands are tied... by the law.

466
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,980
You know what, Joe?

467
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,220
The law is an ass.

468
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,540
Why do you ring me
when the surgery's right there?

469
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,460
I didn't want to see HIM.
I need a lift to another doctor.

470
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,180
Isn't there a clinic in Wadebridge?

471
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:06,060
I can't believe you let
Angie Grappy look after my baby!

472
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,260
I was ill.
I couldn't cope with a baby.

473
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,580
But you're well enough
to come and cook for Bert?

474
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,300
Please don't tell me off!

475
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,380
You can't even look after
your own grandson?

476
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:17,060
Not now, Lulu,
I'm not strong enough.

477
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,620
(AGONISED GROANS) I feel sick.

478
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:23,020
In that case,
you're coming over the road with me.

479
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:26,260
When did the pain start?
It only got really bad today.

480
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,300
I think it's something I ate.

481
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,940
(SCREAMS)

482
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:35,700
This isn't food poisoning.
It's an umbilical hernia.

483
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,660
It's never played up like this
before.

484
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,340
What do you mean 'before'?
I had it checked over in Spain.

485
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:43,940
Why didn't you get it dealt with?
I had places to go, people to see.

486
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,780
It's obstructed your intestine now.

487
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,300
Morwenna!

488
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,700
Congratulations.
You have a strangulated hernia

489
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,700
and need an operation
as soon as possible.

490
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,980
Morwenna! Call an ambulance
and tell them it's urgent.

491
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:58,420
They'll probably guess, if I've
dialled 999, cos people only do it...

492
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,460
Just call them!

493
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,580
(TAPS KEYBOARD)

494
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,300
Call someone and have it repaired.

495
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:32,460
It'll be cheaper than paying you
to stand around staring at it.

496
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,500
Yeah. OK.

497
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,180
I think it's time you told me.

498
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,300
Told you what?

499
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,340
What it is that's bothering you.

500
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,780
It's... erm...

501
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,620
It's nothing. Just...

502
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:54,940
Your work has ground to a halt.
You have hives and insomnia.

503
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:57,140
You look as vacant as the chickens.

504
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,500
It's clearly not nothing.

505
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,860
Look, I just...

506
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,140
I don't really want
to talk about it right now.

507
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,500
Al...

508
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,460
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

509
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,340
My... My dad borrowed some money

510
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:25,540
from a couple of blokes
and I had to pay them back.

511
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,300
Or they were gonna...

512
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,420
Well, we don't know
what they were gonna do,

513
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,180
but they were gonna do something.

514
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,220
That's not a good situation.

515
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,980
Very uncomfortable, I imagine.

516
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,820
I was just trying to help Dad.

517
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,540
I... er...

518
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,700
I gave them your fence money.

519
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,140
I see.

520
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,180
And were you going to tell me this?

521
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,380
Probably not.

522
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,900
Right.
I was gonna find the money,

523
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,780
before I had to pay for the fence.

524
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,620
Oh, Al...

525
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:15,460
That is, once I'd found the money
from somewhere.

526
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,500
In the meantime, you'd just keep
fobbing off the old lady?

527
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,380
Sorry.

528
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,900
Morwenna! If you're asking about
the ambulance again, don't bother.

529
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,540
Is it here?
It's not coming.

530
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,740
They put the call down
as Portweggan.

531
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,540
The ambulance has just arrived
there.

532
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,300
Call another one.
Yeah, I did ask.

533
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,020
They're trying to find one.

534
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,820
Are you happy to wait?
Of course not!

535
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,940
What happens if this one takes ages?
(AGONISED YELLS)

536
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,840
If it's left much longer,
the intestine will

537
00:29:54,841 --> 00:29:57,020
become gangrenous and
she'll die of septicaemia.

538
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,300
Or she'll need major surgery
and a colostomy.

539
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,180
Which is why I'm going to operate.
What?

540
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,620
Wash your hands.
Why? You're going to help me.

541
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:07,940
Yes! Only do what I tell you to do
when I tell you to do it.

542
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,380
Right. I won't have to use a needle,
will I?

543
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,820
I'm really not good with needles.
Shut up.

544
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:16,260
A scalpel I could probably manage.
Or I could help instead.

545
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,300
Erm, no.

546
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:23,420
Martin! I was just going to get
some surgical packs.

547
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,300
You will look after her?
Yes, of course.

548
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,060
I'll carry out the procedure
to the best of my ability.

549
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,820
It only takes a few minutes.

550
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:34,100
My first incision's about 5cm long,
just above your mother's navel.

551
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,180
Then I use forceps
to hold the skin back.

552
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,900
Then I'll go in and cut and remove
the hernia sac.

553
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,940
All right?
Yes, OK.

554
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,560
Aren't you forgetting something?
What?

555
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,720
I'm still awake.
Yes.

556
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,840
And you will be
throughout the procedure.

557
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,880
I thought that injection
was supposed to knock me out.

558
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,320
No, that was morphine
to numb the pain of your hernia.

559
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,600
Oh, God.
You keep that thing away from me.

560
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,320
Shush.

561
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,560
I'm just going to give you
a local anaesthetic,

562
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,520
so you don't feel anything
when I make the incision.

563
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:26,520
How long does it take to work?
Just a few seconds.

564
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,440
I like to listen to some music
when I'm at the dentist's.

565
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,200
You're not at the dentist's.
So just... be quiet.

566
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,240
Charming!

567
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,200
I'm going to make the first incision.

568
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,120
Are you ready to swab the blood?
Blood?

569
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,160
OK. I'll try not to pass out.

570
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,360
What are you doing now?
Be quiet.

571
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,440
Right.

572
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,360
What are you doing?

573
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,760
That's it. Just need to close up now.

574
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,760
I can close up, if you like.

575
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,800
I'll give it a go,
if you talk me through it.

576
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,840
Don't be ridiculous.

577
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,480
You can go in here.
You'll like it together in here.

578
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,440
You go in with Sammy.

579
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,600
Oh, no, you don't.
(SIREN BLARES)

580
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,920
(SCREAMS)

581
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,400
Mrs Dingley?

582
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,840
Oh, you coming to us, and early.
I like that.

583
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,560
Well, you won't like this.

584
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,280
We're not gonna pay you.

585
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,560
(LAUGHS)

586
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,840
That's funny.
Well, we mean it.

587
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,400
You've still got an hour
to change your mind.

588
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,040
Now, if you'll excuse us, we've got
to go and see little Mrs Dingley.

589
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,160
And I've got a feeling she's not
going to be too pleased to see us.

590
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,000
What a shame (!)

591
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,040
Norman!

592
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,880
Thanks, Martin.
Yes.

593
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,920
Right.

594
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,200
I'm going to take James
in the ambulance with Mum. Right.

595
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,280
Are you sure it went OK?
Yes.

596
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,320
(PHONE RINGS)

597
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,720
She'll be fine.

598
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,400
Doc, PC Penhale's on the phone.
He says he needs you.

599
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:36,680
Doc's on his way. When he heard it was
me, he said he'd drop everything.

600
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,940
Well, didn't exactly say
that, but I know that's

601
00:34:38,941 --> 00:34:41,160
what he meant from the way
he hung the phone up.

602
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,200
TONKEN: What's happened here?
Ow!

603
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,960
It's all under control.
We want to talk to Mrs Dingley.

604
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,880
But if there's been
some kind of an accident...

605
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,280
Oi! You leave her alone.

606
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,000
I was merely enquiring
after Mrs Dingley's health.

607
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,240
Course you were (!) These are the
loan sharks I told you about, Joe.

608
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,560
Who are you calling loan sharks?

609
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,600
Mrs Dingley?
Over here.

610
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,520
I'm not here to ask Mrs Dingley
for money.

611
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,360
You say that now
with the police here,

612
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,320
but we know you've come to bully her
till you get what you want.

613
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,160
I don't know what you're on about.

614
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,040
How many fingers am I holding up?

615
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,160
I'm not an idiot. Two.

616
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,600
Follow this one
without moving your head.

617
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,400
I need to have a look in your eyes.

618
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,440
(SOUNDS OF AN ARGUMENT)

619
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,080
Hold still.

620
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,520
What are you doing?
I'm looking in your eyes.

621
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,760
I can see tiny spots on your retina.

622
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,720
Do you often get little shapes
floating around in front of your eyes?

623
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:46,320
Shapes? All I can see
is a big bright light.

624
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,880
Hm.
Ah! Oh, now it's gone.

625
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,560
Oh, now it's come back again.

626
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,040
Not only do you have arcus senilis,

627
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,120
you also have
birdshot chorioretinopathy.

628
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,520
Is that good or bad?
No, it's not good,

629
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,640
but with steroids and immune-
suppressants, you won't go blind.

630
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:07,040
Oh, that's a relief
because my poor cats need me.

631
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,080
(ARGUMENT CONTINUES)

632
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,000
Can you get rid of those people?

633
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,120
I could arrest them,
but only if they start

634
00:36:13,121 --> 00:36:15,200
a fight which causes
terror to the public.

635
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,000
That's the legal definition.
(ARGUMENT CONTINUES)

636
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,040
Shut up, all of you!

637
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,520
Here, Doc. Has my son got hives?
How should I know?

638
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,560
Well, can you take a look?

639
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,240
Fleas. Flea bites.

640
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,680
Have you got a dog?

641
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,800
How long have you had it?
A few days.

642
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,600
Mrs Dingley gave it to Norman
because she didn't have the...

643
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,640
Well, anyway, she just gave it him.

644
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,240
Does it sleep in the van?
With Norman.

645
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,800
And when did your rash first appear?
Dunno.

646
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,160
It was yesterday.
Right, then.

647
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,200
That's where your rash came from.

648
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,800
Would you like a diagram?
I have a patient.

649
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,040
You heard the doc.
Get rid of the kitten.

650
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,920
No.

651
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,960
It's for your own good, Norman.

652
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,760
We're not going to pay you
any more money.

653
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,280
There's nothing you can do about it.
That's right.

654
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,640
Oh, there might be nothing
I can do about it perhaps,

655
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:22,720
but I wouldn't like to predict what
Norman's gonna do the state he's in.

656
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,800
He's like a wild beast
when he's upset.

657
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,840
Can I just stop you there?

658
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,560
Up until now
this has been a civil matter.

659
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,400
However, what you just said
sounded like a threat to me.

660
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,320
I wasn't threatening anyone.
Good.

661
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:37,240
That would be a criminal matter
and I'd have to take action.

662
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,200
If you harass these gentlemen,
I will arrest you.

663
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,000
But... But they owe me money!

664
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,680
Mrs Dingley does too.
You can't expect me to just...

665
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,680
walk away.
Walk away? No.

666
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,040
Drive away? Yes.

667
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,400
I don't want you coming
near this village again.

668
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,840
If you do, I shall have to take
a close look at this van of yours.

669
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,360
Check it's roadworthy,
check it's taxed, check it's insured.

670
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:08,000
That will take a very long time and
I will do it over and over again.

671
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,040
Do I make myself clear?

672
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,520
Go on, Norman, get rid of the cat
and let's get out of here.

673
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,480
(BABY VOICE) Bye, Mummy! Bye!

674
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:40,880
You know, you wouldn't fall so much,
if you bought some new spectacles.

675
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,440
Yeah, I know. I will, I promise.

676
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,680
A little soap wouldn't go amiss
either.

677
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,280
Can I question this suspect, Doc?
What do you mean 'suspect'?

678
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,120
I believe Mrs Dingley knows
something about criminal damage

679
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,080
to a motor vehicle
in the harbour car park.

680
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,160
Oh, God.
I don't think this is a great time.

681
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,440
No, I want to make my confession.

682
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,720
Mrs Dingley,
he's a policeman, not a priest.

683
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,560
I broke the window in that car.

684
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:08,880
Well, I saw the tide was coming in
and I saw this dog on the back seat.

685
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,800
There was a dog?
No. It turned out to be a fur coat.

686
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:17,880
So you broke the window to save the
dog that turned out to be a coat?

687
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,440
Yeah. I know. I'm sorry.
I'll pay for the window.

688
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,160
No, I can't, actually. I can't.

689
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,520
(TEARFULLY)
I'm very sorry, but I can't.

690
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,800
(SOBS) Sorry. I'm so sorry.

691
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,000
Never mind, Mrs Dingley.
No harm done.

692
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,240
Apart from the criminal damage.

693
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,080
But... we'll say no more.

694
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,880
Right, boy, we do one of these every
week, we'll soon be in the black.

695
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,920
Proper job.

696
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,160
Right, I'll go and check
on the prawns.

697
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,200
Thanks for coming.

698
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,840
So you have a proposal for me?

699
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,880
I've been thinking.

700
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,080
What if I offered you...

701
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:03,120
10% of the restaurant's profits?

702
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,200
And... And... And also my scooter.

703
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,480
And I'll pay you back in one go.
Well, almost.

704
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,760
Well, thank you, Al, but I don't
think you've thought this through.

705
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,200
How are you going to turn up
for work without the scooter?

706
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,800
Er...

707
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,240
I sort assumed that
I didn't work for you any more.

708
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,600
You didn't for a while.

709
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,080
Could you get me a glass of Rioja?

710
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,480
Si.

711
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,480
(SPANISH THEME MUSIC DRIFTS IN)

712
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,520
How's your mother?
Comfortable.

713
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,080
Whatever that means.

714
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,120
But the consultant said
you saved her life.

715
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,120
Yes, and her bowel.

716
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,800
I'm really grateful.

717
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,160
So...

718
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,600
Did you enjoy it,
being a surgeon again?

719
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,920
I didn't do it for fun, Louisa.
Still...

720
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,280
it must have been nice
to have a bit of practice

721
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,040
before you go back to London.

722
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,440
I was just going to ask if you
could look after James for a while.

723
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,480
Now? Yeah.
Why?

724
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,800
Well, you could just say,
'I'd be happy to help.'

725
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:46,000
I would be happy to help. Good.
I wanted to pop across the road.

726
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,000
It's Spanish theme night
at the restaurant,

727
00:42:48,001 --> 00:42:49,960
and Mum asked me to report back.

728
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,640
Yeah.

729
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,440
I'm assuming you don't want to come.
No.

730
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,480
No. I didn't think so.

731
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,840
Er... right.

732
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,840
I'll be back in a while.

733
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,000
Thank you.

734
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:09,240
Er, Louisa?
Yes, Martin.

735
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,400
Could you ask them to switch
the music off? It's very loud.

736
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:15,280
Yes, Martin.
Mm.

737
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,920
Just finish off the washing up,
and we'll have some fun.

738
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,440
Martin!

739
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,240
Hello, love.
Clive!

740
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,320
She seems to have formed
a fixation on me.

741
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,960
Why?

742
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,880
I think you'd better tell me
what's been going on here, Doc.
