00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,160
We're out of syrup.

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:06,479
Huh. You know what?

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,840
Maybe I'll use my intern.

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,269
- Glootie?
- Good?

5
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,079
- Thanks, Glootie.
- Anything else?

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,409
Do you want to develop an app?

7
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,219
- No thanks, Glootie.
- Hey, what's up, Glootie?

8
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,739
Hi, Morty. Do you want
to develop an app?

9
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,119
- No thanks.
- Rick, why does it say,

10
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,290
"Do not develop my app,"
on your intern's forehead?

11
00:00:21,292 --> 00:00:22,619
Why, you want to develop one?

12
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:23,859
Ah, I'm glad you asked that, Jerry.

13
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,588
It's so you don't develop his app.

14
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:27,789
Glootie, go make some photocopies

15
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:28,799
- of something.
- Cool.

16
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,135
Well, if anyone wants to develop
an app with me, I'm down.

17
00:00:31,136 --> 00:00:34,060
He seems to really want
to develop an app.

18
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,079
He really does, sweetie,
but nobody's gonna do that.

19
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,569
Now, if you'll excuse me,

20
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,799
I've got a quick solo
adventure to go on,

21
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,859
and this one will not be directed

22
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,479
- by Ron Howard.
- He's gonna go poop.

23
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,799
When Grandpa Rick
pats his belly like that

24
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,439
and leaves without Morty, it
means he's going to go poop.

25
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,919
He's a shy pooper. He has
a secret pooping place.

26
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,379
Man, [BLEEP] you, Summer.

27
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,299
Honey, why can't you get
this excited about your SATs?

28
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,049
Well, I'm man enough to simply
say, "I'm going to poop,"

29
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:57,999
and I'd be honored to have

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,869
- Ron Howard involved.
- Good job, hon.

31
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:01,470
- Way to go, Dad.
- We're rooting for ya.

32
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:07,139
He's really putting you to work, huh?

33
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,400
Did you want to develop an app?

34
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,779
- I'll pass, Glootie.
- Hmm, your loss.

35
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,400
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

36
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:13,939
Eh, it's an app you'd want to develop.

37
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,379
- Can I ask what it is?
- Of course you can.

38
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,019
That's always the first
step in app development.

39
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,978
Ah.

40
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:23,929
50/50! Final offer!

43
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:23,049
Reverse digestion extrapolation.

44
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,767
Time to meet your maker.

45
00:03:27,408 --> 00:03:28,800
What are you guys doing?

46
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:30,272
Did you develop an app?

47
00:03:30,273 --> 00:03:32,339
Rule number one in app
development, son...

48
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,439
never follow the rules.

49
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,679
Except when the rule is tattooed
on an alien's forehead, Dad.

50
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,444
Why do you think Rick
would have that rule?

51
00:03:38,445 --> 00:03:40,139
'Cause he's a disrupt-o-phobe.

52
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,169
No, Dad, no.

53
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,992
To keep something
horrible from happening,

54
00:03:42,993 --> 00:03:44,819
something he's too lazy to explain.

55
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,622
Guys, we're getting our first users.

56
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,299
Whoa, this new app just matched me

57
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,779
with a guy that is su my ty.

58
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,019
Super my type. Learn to abbre.

59
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,079
Hey!

60
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,009
Your su ty works at Jersey Mike's

61
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,019
and sees 25 Phish shows a year.

62
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,569
- That is so Danny.
- Summer!

63
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,839
- Danny?
- Summer Smith?

64
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,389
Danny Publits from Lovefinderrz

65
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,519
with two "R's" and a "Z"?

66
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,180
I ran all the way here while
staring at your profile.

67
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:13,919
I tripped on a fire
hydrant and fell down,

68
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,899
so I'm covered in gravel
that stuck to my sweat.

69
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,040
And even after a shower,

70
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,487
I'll still be into a jam
band for old junkies,

71
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:21,619
but I think this world
cares too much about bands

72
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,860
and too little about love.

73
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:26,329
- And I think I love you.
- Me, too.

74
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,839
Hi, I'm my underage daughter's mother.

75
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,330
Nice to... whoa!

76
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:32,599
Come on. Just met.

77
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,059
Uh, this isn't working.

78
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,599
Wait. What are you...

79
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,979
Never mind.

80
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,839
I quit, I'm gay, and I love Xander.

81
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,303
Stupid phones are destroying us.

82
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,419
Hey, sweetie.

83
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,579
Honey, our daughter ran
off with a Frisbee golfer

84
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,479
because of some app with a really dumb,

85
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,779
really forgettable name.

86
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,460
Like a really dumb, uncreative,
super sweaty name.

87
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,999
- _
- Anyway, I'll be late. I love you.

88
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,309
Got it. I love you, too.

89
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,720
Okay, Glootie, take the app down.

90
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,364
Can't take it down. I'm just an intern.

91
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,159
Uh, that's not how apps work.

92
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,899
Then make it how it works.

93
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,859
This isn't how making things work works.

94
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,082
Get... get it off the server.

95
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,939
Y-You think we're stupid, but we're not.

96
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,878
We know apps have something
to do with servers.

97
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:18,171
The server's on the mother ship.

98
00:05:18,172 --> 00:05:19,279
Where's the mother ship?

99
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,899
- It's coming.
- Take us to it.

100
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,759
- No.
- Yes. Shake him more, Morty.

101
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,990
- That was working.
- Take us to the mother ship.

102
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,484
Okay, don't hurt me. Don't hurt me.

103
00:05:39,485 --> 00:05:41,361
An ominous beeping app.

104
00:05:41,362 --> 00:05:43,540
You can't stay made at a
guy with this kind of talent.

105
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:45,408
Dad, you can, and you have to.

106
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:51,619
_

107
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,540
- Ribbit, ribbit.
- Ribbit, ribbit.

108
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,999
- Hey, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit!
- Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit!

109
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,419
Look at this guy. He
wants to eat me so bad.

110
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,659
You want to eat me, don't you?

111
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,679
- Ribbit.
- Just kidding. Have some drugs.

112
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,839
- Are you Vermigurber?
- What does this guy want?

113
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,779
- Who is this monkey?
- I'm here about a sandwich.

114
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,380
Oh, well you came to the right place...

115
00:06:06,387 --> 00:06:08,264
... 'cause you're about
to get a bullet sandwich

116
00:06:08,265 --> 00:06:11,079
on two slices of whole... gun.

117
00:06:12,143 --> 00:06:13,810
You might want to get that.

118
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:16,570
Hello?

119
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:18,769
Dad, give the human whatever he wants.

120
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,599
He knows where I live. He's crazy!

121
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,219
You [BLEEP] idiot.

122
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,406
I have 800,000 kids.

123
00:06:26,407 --> 00:06:27,782
Don't forget your voicemail.

124
00:06:27,783 --> 00:06:32,839
You have 470,000 messages.

125
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,499
Oh, ah, that's half of them.

126
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,059
Okay, w-w-what do you
want? What do you want?

127
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,379
Wait, this is seriously
about sandwiches?

128
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,699
I thought this was about drugs or guns

129
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,919
or the fact that I'm a fly
that runs a frog restaurant.

130
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,319
There's a million things that
are interesting about me,

131
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,619
and none of them are sandwiches.

132
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,119
- Who ordered it?
- Talk to our delivery drone.

133
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,640
He... he run off to fight
in the robot wars.

134
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,219
Hey, ape man, I hope this was worth

135
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,139
making a whole swarm of enemies.

136
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,480
It will be when I find
whoever shit in my toilet.

137
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:04,739
Is that code for something?
Someone look that up.

138
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,340
If that's drug slang, I need to know it.

139
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:09,779
Ah!

140
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,879
- Mom, you can't stop true love.
- Oh, yes, I can.

141
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,519
- You're assaulting me!
- Keep your voice down.

142
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,979
- I'm being assaulted!
- Oh, yeah? Okay.

143
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,419
- Statutory rape!
- Whoa.

144
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,560
My daughter's about to be raped!

145
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:20,840
No, I'm not! I'm being assaulted!

146
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,139
- Rape!
- Assault!

147
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,419
- Rape!
- Nobody cares. It's a motel.

148
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,279
Nobody's here because
their life's going so great

149
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,019
they can afford to get
mixed up in yours.

150
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,424
Deal with this [BLEEP] on your own.

151
00:07:29,425 --> 00:07:32,099
You can't stop us from
getting a motel room.

152
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,239
Fine. I'll get one, too.

153
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,479
I'm getting the one next door,

154
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,249
and I'm putting a glass to
the wall, and I'm listening.

155
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,239
- Fine. Enjoy.
- I will.

156
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,065
- I'm Danny, by the way.
- You had your chance, dick.

157
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,339
- Take your app down.
- T-Take... take it down.

158
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,619
- What?
- I'm their hostage.

159
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,639
- Do they have weapons?
- Nope, but neither do I.

160
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,299
Do... do you have a weapon?

161
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,819
No.

162
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,339
- Take the app down.
- Take the app down.

163
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,659
I can't. I'm an intern.

164
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,670
Okay, well who tells interns what to do?

165
00:07:58,679 --> 00:07:59,999
Not you, that's for sure.

166
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,719
Take us to whoever does,

167
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,919
or w-w-we'll... we'll punch you.

168
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,439
Okay.

169
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,949
Not bad, Morty.

170
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,779
Yeah, I don't know when the
other shoe's gonna drop,

171
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,345
but this is working pretty good so far.

172
00:08:11,346 --> 00:08:12,509
Greetings.

173
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,359
We are the Monogatrons.

174
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,739
While your species was
still toying with fire,

175
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,359
ours mastered the
science of functioning,

176
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,179
committed relationships.

177
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,079
As the latest planet to develop our app,

178
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,689
you will now witness the true
power of superior intimacy.

179
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:28,979
Take the app down.

180
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,781
Take it down, or... we'll...
we'll... we'll punch you.

181
00:08:31,782 --> 00:08:34,079
Is there someone with a gun or...

182
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,419
It's on its way.

183
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,449
The app remains up.

184
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,079
So what's the evil plan?

185
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,119
Does there have to be an evil plan?

186
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,539
- Oh, uh, uh...
- Uh, someone wanted a gun?

187
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,899
I'll take it. Thanks.

188
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,370
Here's the evil plan.

189
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:46,590
- [BLEEP]
- Goddamn it.

190
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:48,479
As a preapp civilization,

191
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,389
your love's value is
defined by scarcity.

192
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,329
You are highly trained to seek it,

193
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:58,139
and you have no idea how to maintain it.

194
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,540
Had you bothered to master love,

195
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:04,063
you would've learned by now,
it is as abundant as water.

196
00:09:04,064 --> 00:09:06,316
You know what isn't? Water.

197
00:09:06,317 --> 00:09:08,399
That [BLEEP] runs out.

198
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,579
So we'll be taking yours.

199
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,619
While your planet continues
to dick around with a, uh...

200
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,579
what is their version of it called?

201
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,750
Lovefinderrz, with two "R's" and a "Z."

202
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:19,729
- Oof.
- Yeah, not my idea.

203
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,739
- Goddamn.
- Am I interrupting?

204
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:25,459
- Impossible. Here she is.
- Mwah.

205
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,999
Your prisoners are getting away.

206
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,779
Prisoners are just things.

207
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,079
Connect with me. Tell me about your day.

208
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,599
I had an incredible meeting.

209
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,802
Did you know humans are 80% water?

210
00:09:35,803 --> 00:09:38,473
And I found a new podcast
we can listen to tonight.

211
00:09:38,474 --> 00:09:40,919
Love it. Okay, back to work.

212
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,645
Find and kill those earthlings.

213
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,419
We're outnumbered. There's no hope.

214
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,689
Then we go out in glory.

215
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,579
Flesh intruder, prepare to die.

216
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,489
Oh, hold on.

217
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,663
My apologies, Lieutenant Commander.

218
00:10:00,664 --> 00:10:02,790
No problem. At ease, Soldier.

219
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,759
Initiate Employee Evaluation Mode.

220
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,439
- Accessing delivery archive.
- Okay, listen.

221
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,339
You delivered an avian
protein club sandwich

222
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,299
with no lettu... Goddamn it.

223
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,019
Oy, scoping for this bit, then?

224
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,299
Alright, a-a-alright.
I know you want to have

225
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,990
the big guy/little guy fight, but...

226
00:10:41,996 --> 00:10:44,415
Aw, are you [BLEEP] kidding me?

227
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,559
Here at the Midland Quasar,

228
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,919
where, in a complete upset,

229
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,050
the Robolution has
overturned the lizards.

230
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:54,674
- It's totally unexpected.
- Uh, I understand, Mr. Phillips.

231
00:10:54,675 --> 00:10:56,849
Yes.

232
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:58,799
I believe this is yours.

233
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,239
You, uh... you dropped that.

234
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,189
I'll have to call you back.

235
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,859
Where do you want to die?

236
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,353
Susan, is conference
room three available?

237
00:11:08,354 --> 00:11:11,819
Can I look at a photo of
my wife while you kill me?

238
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,299
Sure, but I'm doing her a favor.

239
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,439
She either has terrible taste,

240
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,659
or she's trapped in a
marriage to a toilet thief.

241
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,440
She's dead.

242
00:11:18,449 --> 00:11:20,010
And I don't mind joining her.

243
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:23,749
Life has been hollow since I lost her.

244
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,219
Using your toilet was nice, though.

245
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,875
I'm a bit of a shy pooper.

246
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,970
I'm ready when you are.

247
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,740
Stay there.

248
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:38,879
Tell him what you told me.

249
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,980
What is this? What's happening?

250
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,119
Tell him what you told me.

251
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,379
My wife's still alive.

252
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,639
Sh... sh... she went into
remission 10 years ago.

253
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,739
And what did you do today?

254
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,100
Oh, I, uh, pooped

255
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:48,970
on a really awesome toilet I found...

256
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:51,439
oh, ow, ow, ow, ow, oh!

257
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,659
Don't use your dead wife as an excuse.

258
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,259
You [BLEEP] on my toilet because
you don't know your place,

259
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,049
and your place is nothing.

260
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,859
So next time you stumble onto a toilet

261
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,250
that feels too good for
your ass, trust me, it is.

262
00:12:03,257 --> 00:12:04,320
You're not gonna kill me?

263
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:05,989

So why the [BLEEP] are you back here?

276
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,206
After you left, I thought
about what you said

277
00:12:50,207 --> 00:12:51,800
and how much I needed to hear it,

278
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:53,752
but then I thought about
why you were saying it,

279
00:12:53,753 --> 00:12:55,319
who you were really saying it to.

280
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,879
You need the same thing I needed, Rick.

281
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,959
You need someone to give
you, permission to live.

282
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,659
What the... ?

283
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,177
I thought you were a shy pooper.

284
00:13:03,178 --> 00:13:05,079
You know what shy pooping is, Rick?

285
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,019
It's a pointless bid for control.

286
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,579
You want to take the one part of life

287
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,739
that you truly think is yours,
and you want to protect it

288
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,349
from a universe that
takes whatever it wants.

289
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,899
It took my wife.

290
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,939
It clearly took something from you.

291
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,999
We can spend our lives fighting that,

292
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,361
or we can choose to be free.

293
00:13:20,362 --> 00:13:22,739
You're right, Tony. I'm done fighting.

294
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,300
Time to be free.

295
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,344
Oh, wait, you're actually
gonna... Oh, God! Oh, God!

296
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,859
- Where am I?
- Hi, little mouse.

297
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,460
Baby bee? I missed you so much.

298
00:13:36,462 --> 00:13:37,962
I never really left you.

299
00:13:37,963 --> 00:13:39,759
Then you know that a few years ago

300
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,719
- I started getting into...
- Strap-on porn?

301
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,659
Yes. I thought it was hot.

302
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,579
- Now, come on.
- Where are you going?

303
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,720
- To poop.
- Where?

304
00:13:46,722 --> 00:13:48,973
Wherever you want, forever.

305
00:13:48,974 --> 00:13:50,329
My God.

306
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,517
You rang?

307
00:13:51,518 --> 00:13:53,769
I'm pooping, too.

308
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:55,119
Come, Tony. Come on.

309
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,483
Come poop with me. Poop with me, Tony.

310
00:13:57,484 --> 00:13:58,699
Poop with me.

311
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,199
What are you waiting for?

312
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,139
Aren't you gonna join us, Tony?

313
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,240
Aren't you gonna join us in the pooping?

314
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:22,719
Where are we? What is this?

315
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,999
That's it. Get out.

316
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,419
You can make a perfectly-realized,

317
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,899
toilet-filled simulation of heaven,

318
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,159
but you can't share a toilet?

319
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,519
Don't insult my craft.

320
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,859
The chemical is Globaflyn.

321
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,640
It connects the
whatever-you-want section

322
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,539
of your brain to the
whatever-you-have section.

323
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,719
If your heaven is
toilets, that's on you.

324
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,019
All of these people...

325
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,160
Are living their wildest,
meaningless dreams

326
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,980
and leaving me out of them.

327
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:45,019
People you refuse to kill and
refuse to let into your life.

328
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:48,359
An offer you rejected, so
here's your last chance.

329
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,519
Goodbye forever. If you
touch my toilet again,

330
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,719
- you die.
- You need a friend.

331
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,459
I have a million cooler
friends than you.

332
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,859
- I'll be seeing you.
- You'll be dying.

333
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,873
- We're gonna be friends.
- You're gonna be dead.

334
00:14:56,874 --> 00:14:58,779
So, we fight our way to the gas line,

335
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,239
we cut it, and then we set a fire.

336
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,260
Okay. Alright.

337
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:03,470
Morty, "Adventures of
Jerry and Morty," huh?

338
00:15:03,471 --> 00:15:05,059
- Put her there.
- Dad, look, y-you know,

339
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,279
w-we don't need to high-five.

340
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,399
It's... it's kind of your fault that
we're in this situation at all.

341
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,179
I know, but, you know, come on.

342
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,500
- "Adventures of Jerry and Morty."
- Okay.

343
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,400
Mwah.

344
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,700
Jeff, I can explain everything.

345
00:15:34,705 --> 00:15:36,080
You don't have to.

346
00:15:36,081 --> 00:15:38,370
Can you just marry us instead?

347
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:39,699
Jeff, don't do it!

348
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,219
Richard.

349
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,019
Maggie.

350
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,999
- Running Bird.
- Let's get out of here.

351
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,919
- Priest Witherspoon.
- Josiah?

352
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,839
Let's get the [BLEEP] out of here.

353
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,799
Summer Smith, let's get
the hell out of here.

354
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,719
You had me at my own name.

355
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,099
Oh, yeah, no. Why would I... ?

356
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,099
Summer! [BLEEP] thing.

357
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,108
Come on. I can't steer this.

358
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,719
What in the hell are you doing?

359
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,929
- Parenting.
- That's not how I did it.

360
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,720
Yeah, where's your daughter?

361
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,529
Ah, you're right.

362
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:14,912
She joined ISIS.

363
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,519
It's Glootie, and he's
had a change of heart.

364
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,789
And he's going to set us free.

365
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,280
Actually, he's been blamed
for bringing you aboard

366
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:25,546
and assigned to execute you.

367
00:16:25,547 --> 00:16:27,080
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay.

368
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:29,549
What would your girlfriend
think of you murdering?

369
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,419
I happen to be between
relationships right now.

370
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:34,569
Really? I thought your species
had perfected relationships.

371
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:35,579
- Here.
- We're not allowed

372
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,399
- to use those apps.
- I wonder why.

373
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:40,186
Yeah, that's what I thought, Glootie.

374
00:16:40,187 --> 00:16:42,659
Looks like you and I...

375
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,140
... are all we've got.

376
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,479
I'm not helping you any more than that,

377
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,599
but if you can find the hangar,

378
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,310
grab a ship and get
the hell out of here.

379
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:52,640
Where you going, Glootie?

380
00:16:52,646 --> 00:16:55,640
I've got a date with
dumping a dating app.

381
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:57,659
Glootie-ootie-ooh!

382
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,679
- Was that ever his thing?
- No.

383
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,699
- He never exited that way.
- No, first time.

384
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,299
Dad, I want to say something.

385
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,990
I started today disgusted and
embarrassed to be your son,

386
00:17:05,993 --> 00:17:07,549
and then later I thought
we were gonna die

387
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,170
because you're a loser.

388
00:17:10,664 --> 00:17:12,329
- There's no more, is there?
- Nope.

389
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:14,304
Now quit [BLEEP] up, and let's go.

390
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,859
Is Tony here? I br...
I brought him some, uh,

391
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:20,109
Vegan Fiber Chili,
delicious family recipe,

392
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:22,099
and a box of these, uh,
chocolates, sugar free.

393
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,599
He can eat as many of these as he wants.

394
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,399
Anyways, uh, just wanted
to drop these off,

395
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,039
and you tell him, uh,
the toilet's all his.

396
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,400
H-He... he'll know what I mean.

397
00:17:29,403 --> 00:17:31,154
Tony died.

398
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,699
- Excuse me?
- He quit his job,

399
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,019
starting living life to the fullest.

400
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,379
He crashed into a tree

401
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,579
space-skiing down Mount Space Everest.

402
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,739
[BLEEP]

403
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,560
There's a Mount Space Everest?

404
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:48,629
Okay. Uh, Jesus.
I-I got to process this.

405
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:50,239
Oh, no, no. You... you
don't want to eat that.

406
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,460
Y-y-you'll... you'll... you'll become

407
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,399
the opening of "The
Beverly Hillbillies."

408
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,639
You know what I'm saying?
A little bubbling crude?

409
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,779
- Texas tea?
- I don't know these references.

410
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,440
Yeah, but you have a Space Everest?

411
00:17:59,447 --> 00:18:01,539
Watch "Space Beverly Hillbillies"

412
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,062
so my jokes can land,
you [BLEEP] [BLEEP].

413
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,460
Now what?

414
00:18:21,469 --> 00:18:22,739
Happily ever after.

415
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,219
And after that?

416
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,200
We'll find out together.

417
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:29,211
Summer how many soul mates
is that in the last week?

418
00:18:29,212 --> 00:18:32,131
Four. You can't stop me from
loving who I love, Mom.

419
00:18:32,132 --> 00:18:33,539
Oh, the [BLEEP] I can't.

420
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,579
I'm gonna mother you
until your 18th birthday,

421
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,410
even if I get thrown in prison
for non-consensual mothering.

422
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:40,549
And even then, I will break out,

423
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,779
come to your house, kick down your door,

424
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,519
and mother your [BLEEP] face
out of your stupid asshole.

425
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,521
I'm gonna daughter your
brains out, bitch.

426
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,029
Mother [BLEEP].

427
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,899
That's my name. Don't wear it out.

428
00:19:05,749 --> 00:19:08,380
Gimme dat new soul mate.

429
00:19:08,382 --> 00:19:10,850
Ad wall?

430
00:19:10,851 --> 00:19:13,380
[BLEEP] this.

431
00:19:13,381 --> 00:19:15,257
- Ad wall?
- What, they want us to pay for it now?

432
00:19:15,258 --> 00:19:16,802
Ugh, ad wall?

433
00:19:16,803 --> 00:19:20,049
Come on, Mom. Let's go home.

434
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:24,049
Great. We lost Earth.

435
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,799
We aren't defined by what we do,

436
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,399
and we only need each other.

437
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,299
Each other... and water.

438
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,314
There's no water?

439
00:19:30,315 --> 00:19:31,839
Honey, the whole point
of conquering Earth...

440
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,740
I know the point of conquering Earth.

441
00:19:33,741 --> 00:19:35,799
- Don't talk to me like...
- Like I'm thirsty?

442
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,799
Like I'm your mother,
you childish prick.

443
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,279
How much water are you sucking

444
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,919
through these stupid [BLEEP]
tubes on your back?

445
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,245
These tubes are cool,
and I want a divorce.

446
00:19:44,246 --> 00:19:48,289
You can have one for a
glass of Goddamn water.

447
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:52,479
Look, uh, on the off-chance
that you used the app

448
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,760
and there's someone out there
waiting for you, I, uh...

449
00:19:55,763 --> 00:19:58,759
Jerry, I didn't use it. Did you?

450
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,419
Me? No. God, of course not.

451
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,310
Well, then, we're all good, dawg.

452
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:12,299
Hey, uh... Hey, uh, Tony's dad,

453
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,899
uh, th-this is, um, $8 billion
in your local currency,

454
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,519
and, uh, this is a kit you
can use to clone a new son.

455
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,279
He... he won't have the same brain.

456
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,139
He'll kind of be an animal man,
but you can teach him stuff.

457
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,519
I-I-I also wanted to let you know

458
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,159
I did explore infinite universes,

459
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,622
and there is a version of
Tony that was completely evil

460
00:20:29,623 --> 00:20:31,260
and ended up causing a lot of genocide

461
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,519
because of how fulfilled he was.

462
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,619
So, really, a lot of
ways of looking at this

463
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,999
as not much of a loss.

464
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,359
I understand.

465
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,470
It's, uh, hard losing a friend.

466
00:20:41,475 --> 00:20:42,719
- [BLEEP] you.
- What?

467
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,429
He's not my friend.

468
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:04,679
There he is. There's our guy.

469
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,760
Congrats, Tony.

470
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:07,379
Have fun with your stupid toilet

471
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,499
that you get to use all by yourself now.

472
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,759
Enjoy using it all by
yourself while you sit there

473
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,479
and think about how nobody
wants to be around you

474
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,039
and how you ruined it for yourself

475
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,569
because you're a huge piece of [BLEEP].

476
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:17,579
Look at you sitting there,

477
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,924
King Shit on his throne of loneliness.

478
00:21:19,925 --> 00:21:22,239
Enjoy this toilet with a thousand of me

479
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,540
screaming every time you take a [BLEEP].

480
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,719
All hail his majesty,

481
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,850
the sa-a-ddest piece of
garbage in the entire cosmos.

482
00:21:30,858 --> 00:21:34,120
Long live the big, bad, doo-doo daddy.

483
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:37,399
May his reign last 1,000 years.

Rick, did you take the Tapatío?

486
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,829
Hmm, Globaflyn?

487
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,259
Thanks.

488
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,440
- I could never lift it up.
- No problem.

489
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:24,947
I'll be able to drink water
for weeks because of you.

490
00:22:24,948 --> 00:22:26,950
It's just part of my job, ma'am.

491

Breaker one nine, this is Jerry Smith.

492
