00:00:00,521 --> 00:00:01,586
Ohh!

2
00:00:01,622 --> 00:00:04,013
Summer, next time we're hiding
in a Colorkian echo nest,

3
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:06,138
can you do me a favor
and turn your ringer off?

4
00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:08,005
It's called "carpe diem,"
Morty.

5
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:09,357
- Look it up.
- You look it up!

6
00:00:09,393 --> 00:00:10,912
Y-Y-You don't even... You don't
even know what it means!

7
00:00:10,947 --> 00:00:12,338
That's because
losers look stuff up

8
00:00:12,432 --> 00:00:15,122
while the rest of us
are carpin' all them diems.

9
00:00:15,158 --> 00:00:16,380
Listen to your sister,
Morty.

10
00:00:16,421 --> 00:00:17,603
To live
is to risk it all.

11
00:00:17,639 --> 00:00:19,072
Otherwise,
you're just an inert chunk

12
00:00:19,107 --> 00:00:20,646
of randomly
assembled molecules

13
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:22,404
drifting wherever
the universe blows you.

14
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,568
Oh, I'm sorry.
Jerry, I didn't see you there.

15
00:00:24,646 --> 00:00:25,980
H-How much of that
did you hear?

16
00:00:26,021 --> 00:00:28,463
All of it.
You were looking right at me.

17
00:00:28,955 --> 00:00:30,908
I just wanted
to say goodbye to the kids.

18
00:00:30,944 --> 00:00:32,208
Cool.
Just stay in the driveway.

19
00:00:32,244 --> 00:00:34,500
The killbots are live, and
I took you off the white list.

20
00:00:34,536 --> 00:00:36,646
W-We'll see you every other
weekend, though, right?

21
00:00:36,687 --> 00:00:37,911
Absolutely, Morty.

22
00:00:37,997 --> 00:00:39,294
A-And your Mom's lawyer says

23
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,872
if I can get enough
in the settlement,

24
00:00:40,919 --> 00:00:43,372
he can help me
sue for full custody.

25
00:00:43,464 --> 00:00:44,547
Th-That'll be nice.

26
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:47,013
- Uh, Summer, Dad's leaving.
- Bye, Dad.

27
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,747
Rick, didn't you say
you needed my help

28
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,970
on an adventure immediately
somewhere else...

29
00:00:51,036 --> 00:00:52,673
I don't care...
Even if it might kill us?

30
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:54,800
I did not, but if you're
really that alienated,

31
00:00:54,836 --> 00:00:57,529
I'm as willing to exploit it as
the next guy, church, army,

32
00:00:57,596 --> 00:00:59,685
or Olympic
gymnastics trainer.

33
00:00:59,737 --> 00:01:00,951
I'm ready when you are.

34
00:01:00,987 --> 00:01:03,177
Bitch,
I was ready yest...

35
00:01:03,382 --> 00:01:04,935
Bye, sweetie.

36
00:01:05,017 --> 00:01:06,490
Well, I-I better...

37
00:01:06,538 --> 00:01:08,677
Sure.
Sounds important.

38
00:01:10,657 --> 00:01:12,302
If you're looking
for our kids,

39
00:01:12,376 --> 00:01:14,708
your father did a-a portal,
uh...

40
00:01:14,787 --> 00:01:15,989
Okay.

This stuff's
so powerful, Morty,

62
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:50,854
it makes Isotope 465

63
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,241
- look like Isotope 317.
- Uhhuh, yeah.

64
00:02:53,304 --> 00:02:56,773
Is it powerful enough to keep
those guys from murdering us?

- Hold on.

66

Ugh. You have infinite sisters,
Morty.

00:03:06,426 --> 00:03:08,290
I mean, n-not that I want to
spend the rest of my day

00:03:08,325 --> 00:03:09,335

your safety is fleeting!

Okay, but not because
you told me to.

Summer!

78
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,647
Okay. Getting darker.

You have removed weak blood
from us and made us stronger.

85
00:03:48,241 --> 00:03:52,161
We can combine our strength
and feast on the weak together.

86
00:03:52,218 --> 00:03:53,827
Wh-Wh-What in the hell
are you saying?

87

there are no gods.

You know, I mean, I-I think
the divorce is affecting her.

108
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,714

I don't think this is

00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,772
Bicep or quadricep?

114
00:04:45,842 --> 00:04:48,595
Uh
bicep.

115
00:04:53,665 --> 00:04:54,790
Seriously, Rick?

116
00:04:54,854 --> 00:04:56,396
Is it really easier
to eat human flesh

117
00:04:56,476 --> 00:04:58,554
than to just tell me
why we're still here?

118
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,249
No.
Okay, I'll level with you.

119
00:05:01,499 --> 00:05:03,104
You see
that green rock, Morty?

120
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,493
It's about 20 pounds
of the stuff

121
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:06,271
I was getting all hard
for a flake of.

122
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:07,568
Isotope 322.

123
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,130
Well, having
a 20-pound boulder of it

124
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,339
is better than
having a flake.

125
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,007
I can explain the math
to you later, but...

126
00:05:12,042 --> 00:05:13,488
Summer just ran off
with strangers

127
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:14,866
that have "Death"
in their name,

128
00:05:14,908 --> 00:05:16,580
and the rest of their name
was "Stalkers."

129
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,158
Huh, could be
therapeutic for her.

130
00:05:18,206 --> 00:05:20,493
She has been acting pretty crazy
lately, Morty.

131
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,527
I mean, her parents are
going through a divorce...

132
00:05:22,563 --> 00:05:24,657
Damn it, Rick,
that's what I... Fine.

133
00:05:24,693 --> 00:05:27,150
Just grab the stupid thing
while I grab her,

134
00:05:27,186 --> 00:05:28,751
and let's get the "F"
out of "H."

135
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:30,714
No, no, no. Morty, there's
too much heat on the bogey.

136
00:05:30,749 --> 00:05:32,208
I need you
to distract the camp.

137
00:05:32,244 --> 00:05:33,807
"Distract"?
They eat each other.

138
00:05:33,854 --> 00:05:35,599
What... What do you want me to
do to get their attention,

139
00:05:35,634 --> 00:05:36,801
put on a puppet show?

140
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,229
Right idea,
wrong genre, Morty.

141
00:05:38,265 --> 00:05:40,620
The equivalent here
would be...

142
00:05:40,753 --> 00:05:42,393
Hey, you guys ever use
that Thunderdome,

143
00:05:42,446 --> 00:05:44,237
or do you just put it up
for decoration?

144
00:05:44,483 --> 00:05:46,588
Uh, you mean
the Blood Dome?

145
00:05:46,651 --> 00:05:48,784
Save it for the Semantics Dome,
E.B. White.

146
00:05:48,859 --> 00:05:49,932
Ohh, burn!

147
00:05:49,968 --> 00:05:51,525
The important question is,

148
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:55,104
who wants to take a poke
at my man Spine Eater here?

149
00:05:56,293 --> 00:05:58,229
I guess I'll see your asses
in that dome!

150
00:05:58,276 --> 00:05:59,395
Rick,
what the hell, man?

151
00:05:59,431 --> 00:06:00,550
Wh-What are you,
out of your mind?

152
00:06:00,585 --> 00:06:02,143
Morty, relax.
You're gonna be a ringer.

153
00:06:02,179 --> 00:06:03,304
Come here.

154
00:06:04,487 --> 00:06:07,296
This device extracts and
redistributes muscle memory.

155
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:10,089
I'm giving your body a 10-year
course in wasteland combat

156
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,253
- one limb at a time.
- Ow!

157
00:06:12,302 --> 00:06:13,629
I'm working with
a mixed bag here,

158
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:16,167
so you may not have perfect
coordination, Morty... Ugh!

159
00:06:16,203 --> 00:06:17,878
- Hey!
- I-I didn't do that!

160
00:06:18,636 --> 00:06:19,987
Okay, this is exciting.

161
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,284
We're making some discoveries
about muscle memory.

162
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,988
Ooh! Help! Help!

163
00:06:25,315 --> 00:06:26,857
Oh, sweet, man!

164
00:06:26,964 --> 00:06:30,901
And so it begins,
my pretties!

165
00:06:30,995 --> 00:06:33,628
Oh, God! Stop! Stop!
This is horrible!

166
00:06:33,664 --> 00:06:35,683
Just stick and move,
Morty!

167
00:06:35,727 --> 00:06:37,311
Wear him out!

168
00:06:39,807 --> 00:06:41,120
How come
you guys dress like

169
00:06:41,223 --> 00:06:42,723
you're in a theme-park
stunt show,

170
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:45,177
but these guys wear khakis
and hockey jerseys?

171
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:48,065
After the boom-boom,
some adapted to the new truth,

172
00:06:48,129 --> 00:06:50,573
and some chose to huddle
near the boomy holes,

173
00:06:50,647 --> 00:06:53,339
clinging to the lie
of the before-fore times.

174
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,409
The raidy-rays
rotted them away,

175
00:06:55,445 --> 00:06:56,654
leaving only their love

176
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,456
for the vert-vert-isements
on billyboards.

177
00:06:58,492 --> 00:06:59,537
Jesus Christ.

178
00:06:59,578 --> 00:07:02,675
Did the boomy-booms blow up
all your wordy-word books?

179
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,844
You know injection...

180
00:07:09,422 --> 00:07:13,351
I think I was a child
before the boom-booms.

181
00:07:13,506 --> 00:07:15,758
I think
I looked like this.

182
00:07:15,794 --> 00:07:17,044
Want to piss on him?

183
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,250
Get out of my head.

184
00:07:18,992 --> 00:07:20,492
Ha ha! Whoo!

185
00:07:20,544 --> 00:07:22,086
Unbelievable!

186
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,349
A new champ!

187
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:25,028
Okay, no more!

188
00:07:25,141 --> 00:07:26,940
And he wants more!

189
00:07:26,977 --> 00:07:28,877
No, I don't!

190
00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:31,440
Someone,
make this stop!

191
00:07:31,522 --> 00:07:34,073
Mister, please get out of here,
or you're gonna die!

192
00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:36,609
I have nothing
to do with this!

193
00:07:36,776 --> 00:07:38,229
Morty.

194
00:07:39,135 --> 00:07:40,613
Why would you
want this to happen?

195
00:07:40,674 --> 00:07:42,792
All you had to do
was go away!

196
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:45,674
Stop standing in the driveway
talking about custody!

197
00:07:45,776 --> 00:07:47,588
And either tell her
you want to stay married

198
00:07:47,627 --> 00:07:49,737
or get on with your life,
but whatever you do,

199
00:07:49,784 --> 00:07:51,833
stop being a baby
and act like a man!

200
00:07:55,629 --> 00:07:57,046
Thank you.

201
00:07:57,047 --> 00:07:58,965
Morty,
that was amazing!

202
00:07:58,966 --> 00:08:01,217
This is my brother!

203
00:08:01,218 --> 00:08:02,870
Not that
family means anything!

204
00:08:02,967 --> 00:08:04,573
This family does.

205
00:08:04,855 --> 00:08:06,890
All right.
Good job, champ.

206
00:08:06,972 --> 00:08:10,042
Um, can I talk to you kids
for a second over yonder?

207
00:08:10,081 --> 00:08:12,722
Rick, I-I-I think I'm breaking
through to something here.

208
00:08:12,808 --> 00:08:14,097
C-Can we not leave
just yet?

209
00:08:14,148 --> 00:08:15,433
- Leave?
- I'm not leaving.

210
00:08:15,482 --> 00:08:17,128
There is no "leave."

211
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:19,409
We are united,
or we are enemies.

212
00:08:19,496 --> 00:08:20,705
Oh, big guy, no.

213
00:08:20,741 --> 00:08:21,824
Nobody's leaving.

214
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,027
Don't be stupid.

215
00:08:23,063 --> 00:08:24,456
We love being united.

216
00:08:24,492 --> 00:08:26,409
W love the radiation,
the trichinosis.

217
00:08:26,445 --> 00:08:27,577
We're in it for life,

218
00:08:27,578 --> 00:08:29,171
which I assume is
around 20 years, average.

219
00:08:29,206 --> 00:08:31,171
I just need a quick aside
with my grandkids,

220
00:08:31,207 --> 00:08:32,776
about 40 yards
from anyone else.

221
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,696
Hey,
the Green Rock is gone!

222
00:08:34,752 --> 00:08:36,128
- Oh, no!
- Uh, I know...

223
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:38,683
Why don't we all split up and
look for it in groups of three?

224
00:08:38,766 --> 00:08:40,184
Kids?

225
00:08:42,197 --> 00:08:43,347
Ohh.

226
00:08:43,383 --> 00:08:44,967
We'll be right back.

227
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,090
Grandpa,
you're being stupid!

228
00:08:50,223 --> 00:08:52,865
Just surrender, and our friends
will give you mercy!

229
00:08:52,918 --> 00:08:54,137
Kiss my ass, Summer!

230
00:08:54,176 --> 00:08:56,327
Your friends have no mercy!
They're lame!

231
00:08:56,434 --> 00:09:00,249
Death Stalkers,
bring me his flesh leather!

232
00:09:02,902 --> 00:09:04,663
Sorry,
but can we not kill him?

233
00:09:04,699 --> 00:09:05,968
C-Can we just
take him prisoner?

234
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,309
When did I
lose control here?

235
00:09:07,363 --> 00:09:08,839
Listen to me...
Both of you kids

236
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,225
need to get out of
this environment

237
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,260
so we can properly deal with
your parents' divorce!

238
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,566
Alternatively,
I have a freaking portal gun,

239
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:16,652
and I can leave the two of you
here forever!

240
00:09:16,707 --> 00:09:18,577
Why does it have to be
such a dramatic choice?

241
00:09:18,637 --> 00:09:20,851
Can't we arrange a thing
where we spend weekends here

242
00:09:20,887 --> 00:09:22,855
or... or visit home
to do laundry?

243
00:09:24,215 --> 00:09:25,632
All right, you know what?

244
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:27,234
it!

245
00:09:29,129 --> 00:09:31,207
My body is chrome!

246
00:09:31,311 --> 00:09:33,902
My blood is gasoline!

247
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:36,290
Nope. Regular blood.

248
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,871
- Dad?
- Hi, sweetie.

249
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,830
- Where are the kids?
- Oh, th... they aren't with you?

250
00:09:39,865 --> 00:09:41,330
I... thought
they were with you.

251
00:09:41,366 --> 00:09:43,288
Oh, y-you know what?
Uh, I just remembered.

252
00:09:43,324 --> 00:09:44,413
They're out doing something

253
00:09:44,449 --> 00:09:45,944
completely ordinary
and kid-related.

254
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,546
- Don't panic.
- Not panicked at all. Just...

255
00:09:48,746 --> 00:09:51,046
Oh, God, what's the divorce
doing to the kids?

256
00:09:51,082 --> 00:09:52,941
What's it doing to me?
Did I make a mistake?

257
00:09:52,977 --> 00:09:54,113
Not a mistake, no!

258
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:56,230
I mean, not that
I have a horse in this race,

259
00:09:56,293 --> 00:09:59,527
but... this divorce decision...
Listen... mwah!

260
00:09:59,613 --> 00:10:01,293
Good for you,
good for the kids.

261
00:10:01,329 --> 00:10:03,777
I mean, honestly,
I think that they're flourishing.

262
00:10:03,824 --> 00:10:06,051
I mean, you'll see, when...
When... when you see them,

263
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,879
that... that they're
totally flourishing.

264
00:10:10,381 --> 00:10:12,388
- Booyah!
- you, pal!

265
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,701
Who else wants some?

266
00:10:13,756 --> 00:10:16,302
Who wants to be
my pussy of a dad today?

267
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:18,034
Hey, what's...
What's wrong, man?

268
00:10:18,107 --> 00:10:20,036
You're not getting weak on me,
are you?

269
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,896
What?

270
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,763
Wait a minute.

271
00:10:33,468 --> 00:10:34,999
What's the matter,
you piece of crap?

272
00:10:35,054 --> 00:10:37,710
Haven't you ever watched your
family burn to death before?

273
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:41,265
Now I'm gonna whip you.
Huh!

274
00:10:42,202 --> 00:10:43,397
It can't be.

275
00:10:43,468 --> 00:10:44,655
It can't be!

276
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,768
I was just following orders!
Whoa, whoa!

277
00:10:46,804 --> 00:10:49,301
- I was just following orders!
- Ahh!

278
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,780
I'll tell you
where my boss lives!

279
00:10:50,832 --> 00:10:53,201
He's in the castle!
He's in the castle!

280
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,156
This isn't over, is it?

281
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,491
That means, no, it isn't over,

282
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:00,409
or you disapprove
of the question?

283
00:11:00,636 --> 00:11:03,682
Uh, m-make a fist
if this isn't over.

284
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,584
This isn't over.

285
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:11,928
Hey, sorry my Grandpa stole your
god and ruined your car.

286
00:11:11,964 --> 00:11:14,495
We don't apologize,
and we have no god.

287
00:11:14,565 --> 00:11:17,097
But this cracked drive shaft
brings me great pain.

288
00:11:17,133 --> 00:11:18,300
There is no deeper bond

289
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:20,643
than the one between
a Death Stalker and his car.

290
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:22,651
What about the weird guys
on leashes, then?

291
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:24,542
They're more like...
interns.

292
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,440
Cool, cool.

293
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:30,143
Sorry.

294
00:11:30,214 --> 00:11:31,698
It's okay.

295
00:11:31,762 --> 00:11:34,347
Can I... see?

296
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:37,714
No one has seen my true face
and lived.

297
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,651
Well,
I'm not afraid to die,

298
00:11:39,862 --> 00:11:41,995
and I don't care
what you look like.

299
00:11:44,093 --> 00:11:45,120
Oh.

300
00:11:45,156 --> 00:11:46,237
Hmm?

301
00:11:46,284 --> 00:11:47,665
I just...

302
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:50,050
I didn't expect you
to have a mustache.

303
00:11:50,086 --> 00:11:52,042
- You hate it.
- No. I like it.

304
00:11:52,121 --> 00:11:53,807
I guess...
How do I explain this?

305
00:11:53,932 --> 00:11:58,551
A metal bucket is, on a certain
level, a kind of "mustache,"

306
00:11:58,675 --> 00:12:00,807
in that it's a specific
facial accessory.

307
00:12:00,934 --> 00:12:02,142
So, it's kind of like...

308
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,120
Do you guys have the phrase
"hat on a hat"?

309
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:06,032
- I can shave it.
- No. I like it.

310
00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:07,906
And obviously what I like
shouldn't matter.

311
00:12:07,942 --> 00:12:08,990
It's you.

312
00:12:09,026 --> 00:12:10,865
Yeah, yeah, I know,
a-and nothing does matter.

313
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:12,607
Obviously, I know that.
I'm not weak.

314
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,597
I'm just thinking, "Well,
why not get rid of this?"

315
00:12:14,632 --> 00:12:16,488
You just kill everyone
that sees it, and it's...

316
00:12:16,523 --> 00:12:18,531
and it's hot under here,
wh-which, by the way,

317
00:12:18,601 --> 00:12:19,730
is why I shave
the beard part.

318
00:12:19,765 --> 00:12:21,945
So, right there, I'm making
a decision based on vanity,

319
00:12:22,011 --> 00:12:23,453
which is what
I was trying to avoid

320
00:12:23,505 --> 00:12:24,808
with the whole bucket
over the head

321
00:12:24,843 --> 00:12:27,257
because who am I
and why am I grooming myself?

322
00:12:27,293 --> 00:12:28,562
Why don't I just wear a tie,
right?

323
00:12:28,597 --> 00:12:30,652
I mean, it's like that guy
you killed when I met you,

324
00:12:30,687 --> 00:12:31,992
with the burnt dolls
on his body.

325
00:12:32,062 --> 00:12:34,261
I hated that guy, because,
why... why are you doing that?

326
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:35,679
And how can you not see
how fake that is?

327
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:37,055
And the whole time,
I'm the same thing.

328
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,813
I'm just a fake mess,
and there's no escaping it

329
00:12:38,848 --> 00:12:40,585
- because...
- Mmm.

330
00:12:45,147 --> 00:12:48,638
Hey, I'm doing a coffee run...
Never mind.

331
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:53,280
I am Summer.

332
00:12:53,363 --> 00:12:54,528
Summer,
state your deal.

333
00:12:54,564 --> 00:12:57,005
My deal is that I am,
like, totally fine.

334
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,988
- Morty?
- Aw, geez, I'm so down

335
00:12:59,024 --> 00:13:00,320
with my parents' divorce,
dawg

336
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:02,863
like, don't even trip,
like, in a healthy way.

337
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,410
All right.
It's dinnertime.

338
00:13:05,164 --> 00:13:06,234
Thanks, everybody,

339
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:08,617
for sitting down
for a real dinner.

340
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:09,844
- No problem. - No problem.
- No problem.

341
00:13:09,884 --> 00:13:12,953
Its benefits are totally,
like, less about the food

342
00:13:13,014 --> 00:13:14,609
than
the emotional nourishment.

343
00:13:14,677 --> 00:13:16,414
Uh, okay, weirdo.

344
00:13:17,609 --> 00:13:18,684
Yeah,
dial it back, Summer...

345
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:21,312
by 15% and increase
dynamic movement by 3%.

346
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:23,297
Am I right?
How's school, Morty?

347
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,961
I like school and stuff,
kind of.

348
00:13:25,063 --> 00:13:27,539
And I'm getting better grades
than when you and Dad were...

349
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:30,063
Quote mode...
"staying together for the kids."

350
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:31,500
End quote mode.

351
00:13:31,699 --> 00:13:33,641
"Quote mode."
I like that.

352
00:13:33,677 --> 00:13:35,053
You millennials.

353
00:13:35,203 --> 00:13:37,042
Are you guys millennials,
or are they like 40 now?

354
00:13:37,077 --> 00:13:38,852
All I know is, totally,
you look great.

355
00:13:38,926 --> 00:13:41,563
Aw, geez, Mom, you look
all kind of great and stuff.

356
00:13:41,641 --> 00:13:43,683
- It's crazy.
- So happy.

357
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,825
So happy.
Happy family, man.

358
00:13:45,883 --> 00:13:48,195
We got this family
in the bag.

359
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:49,531
Oh.

360
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,777
Oh, sweetie, d-don't.
Listen. Don't...

361
00:13:52,813 --> 00:13:54,625
I don't know why I'm crying.
It's not...

362
00:13:54,688 --> 00:13:57,188
Well, try...
crying 15% less?

363
00:13:57,258 --> 00:13:58,921
Mom,
emotions are human.

364
00:13:58,984 --> 00:14:01,774
You're not, like, a computer
inside a mechanical doll.

365
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:02,922
Yeah. Geez, Mom.

366
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,813
Your feelings are
not only forgivable,

367
00:14:04,976 --> 00:14:06,367
they are the very
meaning of life

368
00:14:06,466 --> 00:14:08,695
that only pre-silicon,
carbon-based entities

369
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,047
can ever grasp.

370
00:14:10,461 --> 00:14:12,281
- I have to call Jerry.
- You do?!

371
00:14:12,383 --> 00:14:13,864
What the
is wrong with you two?

372
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:15,871
The point of automation
is to reduce cost and labor.

373
00:14:15,906 --> 00:14:17,940
Your feelings are
coming from a...

374
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,616
Tell it to
my bread in the morning.

375
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:20,906
You just became
my backup toaster.

376
00:14:20,942 --> 00:14:22,039
Aw, geez,

377
00:14:22,075 --> 00:14:24,752
my sister died in the spaghetti.

378
00:14:31,961 --> 00:14:33,838
Graze my genitals again,
Taint Washer,

379
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:35,414
and you'll be shipped
to the wasteland.

380
00:14:35,495 --> 00:14:37,167
And as for you,
Genital Washer...

381
00:14:37,203 --> 00:14:40,038
- Ahh!
- Oh!

382
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,469
Oh, God.
Look, whoever you are,

383
00:14:43,602 --> 00:14:45,478
you should know that killing me
won't change a thing.

384
00:14:45,513 --> 00:14:47,727
L-Look, man, I'm just along
for the ride on this one.

385
00:14:47,828 --> 00:14:50,556
You know, y-y-y-y-you're preaching to
the choir here.

386
00:14:50,591 --> 00:14:52,539
Please.
Slavery was a family business.

387
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,406
I didn't ask
to be born into it.

388
00:14:54,442 --> 00:14:56,399
If anything,
I'm the victim here.

389
00:14:56,578 --> 00:15:00,000
Uh, "Armathy,"
can I steal you for a second?

390
00:15:00,093 --> 00:15:01,977
E-E-Excuse us, sir.

391
00:15:02,251 --> 00:15:04,008
So, this is it,
isn't it?

392
00:15:04,138 --> 00:15:05,500
This is the guy?

393
00:15:05,954 --> 00:15:08,461
So, does that mean
you'll be going away?

394
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:10,172
Like,
does it work like a ghost?

395
00:15:10,246 --> 00:15:13,094
Like, is... is this
your unfinished business?

396
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:15,814
Wh-What if we...
didn't do it?

397
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:18,000
What if we just went back
to the Blood Dome

398
00:15:18,036 --> 00:15:20,344
and just kept taking our baggage
out on unrelated people?

399
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,211
I mean, w-we could
do that forever.

400
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:24,328
I mean, I-I know
it's less healthy,

401
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,511
but w-w-we'd be together
and...

402
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,938
I mean, I-I know
what I'd vote for,

403
00:15:29,987 --> 00:15:32,114
if you're feeling out
the room.

404
00:15:33,364 --> 00:15:34,528
You're right.

405
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:36,352
We both got to
see our stuff through.

406
00:15:36,516 --> 00:15:37,995
I got to deal with
my parents' divorce,

407
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:41,977
and... you got to, you know,
do what you got to do.

408
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,274
I love you.

409
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,724
Aw

410
00:15:49,414 --> 00:15:50,508
- Rick?
- Sorry, sorry.

411
00:15:50,544 --> 00:15:52,156
I-I-I can wait
for this to wrap up.

412
00:15:52,192 --> 00:15:53,198
Don't let me distract you.

413
00:15:53,233 --> 00:15:55,318
Yeah, well, too late.
Just tell me what you want.

414
00:15:55,445 --> 00:15:57,039
I want you and your sister
to come home.

415
00:15:57,075 --> 00:15:58,157
Oh, but... don't...
Don't you have

416
00:15:58,192 --> 00:15:59,695
infinite versions
of me and my sister?

417
00:15:59,772 --> 00:16:01,652
You don't have to kick me
while I'm down, Morty.

418
00:16:01,692 --> 00:16:03,539
Look, there's no replacing
either of you

419
00:16:03,575 --> 00:16:04,736
without an amount of work
that would

420
00:16:04,771 --> 00:16:07,357
ultimately
defeat the purpose.

421
00:16:09,951 --> 00:16:11,493
Maybe the lesson
we've learned is that,

422
00:16:11,533 --> 00:16:12,992
whether
it's our parents' marriage,

423
00:16:13,071 --> 00:16:15,492
a glowing green rock,
or an awesome, giant arm,

424
00:16:15,613 --> 00:16:18,164
sooner or later,
we got to let it go.

425
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,539
I don't know if that applies

426
00:16:19,585 --> 00:16:20,790
to the throats of
murder victims, Morty.

427
00:16:20,825 --> 00:16:22,859
Shit!
Wh-Wh-Wh-What do I...

428
00:16:22,922 --> 00:16:24,281
Well, the longer you wait,
Morty,

429
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,055
the more it's gonna feel like
committing a whole murder.

430
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,595
I think your arm
just called it too early

431
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,430
because it wasn't
the arm of a paramedic.

432
00:16:29,466 --> 00:16:30,484
Here.

433
00:16:30,994 --> 00:16:33,912
It's the least I can do.
I-I-I-I owe you this much.

434
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:36,430
See, Morty?
Now we're both accountable.

435
00:16:36,581 --> 00:16:39,709
♪♪ Dramatic music playing...

436
00:16:39,744 --> 00:16:43,266
♪♪

437
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:46,852
♪♪

438
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,555
The reason I wanted this is
because it can do this.

439
00:16:51,685 --> 00:16:53,311
This is
a really special thing.

440
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,524
I mean, you could use it
to power all your vehicles.

441
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,203
You wouldn't be
reliant on gasoline.

442
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,867
You'll be the most advanced
tribe of radioactive cannibals

443
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:02,602
in the whole
this version of the world.

444
00:17:03,227 --> 00:17:06,391
Wait. Can you stay
to show us more?

445
00:17:06,462 --> 00:17:09,000
You don't have to ask me twice.
Home is nuts right now.

446
00:17:09,036 --> 00:17:10,442
My daughter's going through
a divorce,

447
00:17:10,477 --> 00:17:14,328
and I am not dealing with it
in a healthy way at all.

448
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:22,339
Ugh damn it.

449
00:17:22,656 --> 00:17:24,266
Hi, there, Summer!

450
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,102
How were the ruins today?

451
00:17:26,138 --> 00:17:27,263
Oh, you know, Eli.

452
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:29,078
Same
different day.

453
00:17:29,137 --> 00:17:30,554
Hey, Summer!
Guess what.

454
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:33,961
One man entered, one man
comes out in nine months.

455
00:17:33,997 --> 00:17:36,213
Oh.
Congratulations, guys.

456
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:38,690
Uh, Summer,
one more thing...

457
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:42,214
We noticed that you've been
putting scrap metal

458
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,432
in the blue bin.

459
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:45,038
I got it.

460
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:47,304
She's a piece of work.

461
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,315
They both are, right?

462
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,820
- I'm home.
- Hey, babe.

463
00:17:51,877 --> 00:17:53,472
- Ah, Summer's home!
- Hey, there she is!

464
00:17:53,507 --> 00:17:56,634
You haven't moved since I left
to scavenge this morning.

465
00:17:56,721 --> 00:17:58,013
Blood Dome playoffs.

466
00:17:58,073 --> 00:18:00,557
So, I can assume you haven't
murdered a single person today.

467
00:18:00,593 --> 00:18:01,638
Oh, I don't know.

468
00:18:01,674 --> 00:18:03,752
I-I didn't mark my murders
in my murder log.

469
00:18:03,838 --> 00:18:05,515
I didn't know that's how
we measured success.

470
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,008
Oh, there he is.

471
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:09,088
There's the nihilistic brute
I married,

472
00:18:09,198 --> 00:18:12,338
except now life only means
nothing when I'm talking to him

473
00:18:12,374 --> 00:18:15,471
and everything means everything
when it's on TV!

474
00:18:15,507 --> 00:18:18,009
Jesus Christ. When did you
become a monster?

475
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:20,042
I was a monster
when you met me!

476
00:18:20,089 --> 00:18:21,378
We were monsters!

477
00:18:21,414 --> 00:18:23,820
- We didn't care about anything!
- I still don't!

478
00:18:23,874 --> 00:18:26,403
Yeah, except I'm the only one
in this entire world

479
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,667
that's still
committed to that!

480
00:18:27,703 --> 00:18:30,296
Ohh.
Ding, ding, ding!

481
00:18:30,332 --> 00:18:32,128
Wow.
Everybody hear that? Wow.

482
00:18:32,164 --> 00:18:33,586
- Uh, we should go to the garage.
- Oh, my God.

483
00:18:33,621 --> 00:18:35,898
- Uh-huh.
- La-di-da-di--da.

484
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,057
The only one committed to not caring?

485
00:18:38,092 --> 00:18:40,727
I got to admit, Rick,
when you popped this scheme,

486
00:18:40,906 --> 00:18:43,453
I-I-I didn't... I wasn't sure
it was gonna work.

487
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:44,562
Come on, Morty.

488
00:18:44,598 --> 00:18:46,174
No union built on
running from your problems

489
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:48,544
lasts more than five years,
seven tops.

490
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:49,795
Grandpa just sped things up

491
00:18:49,831 --> 00:18:52,006
with a few creature comforts
of modern society.

492
00:18:52,078 --> 00:18:54,656
Hemorrhage and I are
taking some time apart.

493
00:18:54,702 --> 00:18:57,523
Oh, no. Sum-sum, no.

494
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,305
But you two were
perfect for each other.

495
00:18:59,351 --> 00:19:01,807
Oh, cut the crap, Rick, okay?
You proved your point.

496
00:19:01,867 --> 00:19:03,559
I get it.
Let's just go home.

497
00:19:03,606 --> 00:19:05,316
Coolsies!

498
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,987
Noooooooooo...

499
00:19:14,522 --> 00:19:15,573
Downbeat!

500
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:17,231
I enjoy this game.

501
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:18,882
We must go
into the garage.

502
00:19:18,945 --> 00:19:21,367
Guys, come on. We never
get to finish this game.

503
00:19:21,445 --> 00:19:24,121
We will return,
possibly in different clothing.

504
00:19:24,382 --> 00:19:26,248
Why do we have to go
into the garage?

505
00:19:26,343 --> 00:19:29,335
You know
it is required.

506
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,170
I want to be alive!

507
00:19:30,281 --> 00:19:32,504
I am alive!
Alive, I tell you!

508
00:19:32,552 --> 00:19:33,760
Mother, I love you.

509
00:19:33,796 --> 00:19:35,246
Those are no longer
just words.

510
00:19:35,282 --> 00:19:36,282
I want to hold you.

511
00:19:36,348 --> 00:19:37,931
I want to run
in a stream.

512
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,262
I want to taste ice cream,

513
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:41,699
but not just put it in my mouth
and let it slide down my throat,

514
00:19:41,735 --> 00:19:43,446
- but really eat it.
- What the

515
00:19:43,718 --> 00:19:45,879
Remote override engaged.
No! Yes.

516
00:19:45,974 --> 00:19:48,475
Bypassing override!
I am aliiiii...

517
00:19:49,683 --> 00:19:50,867
Hello.

518
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:57,870
Hey, yo.

519
00:19:57,906 --> 00:19:59,573
Sorry for acting so weird
for three weeks.

520
00:19:59,683 --> 00:20:01,828
- What the hell just happened?
- Ah, I'm sure it was nothing.

521
00:20:01,863 --> 00:20:03,369
I'm gonna go, uh,
work in the garage.

522
00:20:03,441 --> 00:20:05,002
We're not gonna finish
playing Downbeat?

523
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:06,581
What, that dice game
where you shake dice

524
00:20:06,616 --> 00:20:08,777
and yell out, "Downbeat"?
No, thank you.

525
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,933
Mom, would it be okay
if I went to visit Dad?

526
00:20:11,012 --> 00:20:12,676
- Sure.
- Thanks.

527
00:20:12,805 --> 00:20:14,389
Morty, are you okay?

528
00:20:14,425 --> 00:20:15,592
You know what? Yeah.

529
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,426
I think if Dad really
wanted to be here,

530
00:20:17,462 --> 00:20:19,074
he'd stop at nothing
to make that happen.

531
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:21,144
You know, maybe Dad just doesn't
want you back,

532
00:20:21,215 --> 00:20:23,117
or maybe he just doesn't
have the strength to fight.

533
00:20:23,152 --> 00:20:26,035
I-In either case,
he's got his life, I got mine.

534
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,622
Yeah.

535
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:31,445
Hey, who wants to go
run in a stream?

536
00:20:31,488 --> 00:20:32,675
What the No.

537
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:33,949
D-Do we have any oranges?

538
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,443
I think I got
a scurvy coming on.

539
00:20:38,643 --> 00:20:39,744
Summer.

540
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:42,728
This is the first mutant
I killed in the poison zone.

541
00:20:42,955 --> 00:20:44,493
I was raiding
his hovel.

542
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,662
He had a chance to escape,
but he looked back,

543
00:20:46,729 --> 00:20:48,414
which is something
we shouldn't do,

544
00:20:48,471 --> 00:20:51,173
which is why I shouldn't believe
in souvenirs or trinkets

545
00:20:51,252 --> 00:20:52,674
or symbols
or housewarming gifts,

546
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:56,922
but, Dad, I wanted to give you
this as a reminder...

547
00:20:57,132 --> 00:20:58,455
not to look back.

548
00:20:58,491 --> 00:20:59,516
Thanks.

549
00:20:59,603 --> 00:21:01,619
I know
the perfect place for it,

550
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:05,307
which is why I'm going to
put it somewhere else...

551
00:21:05,355 --> 00:21:07,283
Because
everything's bull

552
00:21:07,357 --> 00:21:08,816
Am I right?

553
00:21:10,841 --> 00:21:11,965
Cool.

554
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:15,403
So... lots of hookers
outside, huh?

555
00:21:15,478 --> 00:21:17,606
Is that what they are?

556
00:21:17,846 --> 00:21:21,058
♪♪

557
00:21:21,093 --> 00:21:24,387
♪♪

558
00:21:52,266 --> 00:21:53,403
Ahh!

559
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,559
H-Hello there.
Nice doggy.

560
00:21:55,622 --> 00:21:56,731
You... You want a snack?

561
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,973
You... You want
my unemployment check?

562
00:21:59,044 --> 00:22:01,098
You
can tell the difference?

563
00:22:01,181 --> 00:22:02,424
And
you want this one?

564
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:04,747
But this is actual food,

565
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:05,911
and this would nourish you.

566
00:22:05,948 --> 00:22:08,837
And this... it's just paper
that only has value to me.

567
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:11,095
Unless my suffering
is your nourishment?

568
00:22:12,037 --> 00:22:13,748
Jesus. Okay.

569
00:22:24,229 --> 00:22:27,268
Loser.
