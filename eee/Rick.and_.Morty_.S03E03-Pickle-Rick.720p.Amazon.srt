00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:03,758
Morty?!

2
00:00:04,899 --> 00:00:06,328
- Morty!
- Rick?

3
00:00:06,429 --> 00:00:08,796
- Hey, Morty?!
- Rick?

4
00:00:08,832 --> 00:00:11,672
Are you far away,
or are you inside something?

5
00:00:11,844 --> 00:00:13,172
Is this a camera?

6
00:00:13,383 --> 00:00:14,844
Is everything a camera?

7
00:00:14,891 --> 00:00:16,518
Morty, the garage, Morty.

8
00:00:16,569 --> 00:00:18,000
Come to the garage!

9
00:00:18,273 --> 00:00:19,303
Morty?

10
00:00:19,366 --> 00:00:21,203
Rick? W-where are you?

11
00:00:21,259 --> 00:00:22,508
On my work bench, Morty.

12
00:00:22,544 --> 00:00:24,598
Are you invisible and you're
gonna, like, fart on me?

13
00:00:24,633 --> 00:00:25,652
Flip the pickle over.

14
00:00:25,688 --> 00:00:26,859
What, I'm gonna touch it,

15
00:00:26,895 --> 00:00:28,945
and you're gonna tell me it's
an alien dick or something.

16
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,445
Come on,
flip the pickle, Morty.

17
00:00:30,546 --> 00:00:33,203
You're not gonna regret it.
The payoff is huge.

18
00:00:33,478 --> 00:00:35,444
I turned myself
into a pickle, Morty!

19
00:00:35,508 --> 00:00:37,680
Boom! Big reveal...
I'm a pickle.

20
00:00:37,716 --> 00:00:38,892
What do you think about that?

21
00:00:38,927 --> 00:00:40,797
I turned myself
into a pickle!

22
00:00:40,977 --> 00:00:42,833
W-what are you just
staring at me for, bro.

23
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,734
I turned myself
into a pickle, Morty!

24
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:45,855
And? And?

25
00:00:45,891 --> 00:00:47,549
What more do you want
tacked on to this?

26
00:00:47,596 --> 00:00:50,286
I turned myself into a pickle,
and 9/11 was an inside job.

27
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:51,709
Was it? Who cares, Morty?

28
00:00:51,756 --> 00:00:53,458
Global acts of terrorism
happen every day.

29
00:00:53,494 --> 00:00:55,568
Uh, here's something
that's never happened before...

30
00:00:55,603 --> 00:00:56,870
I'm a pickle.

31
00:00:56,906 --> 00:00:59,070
I'm Pickle Rick!

35
00:01:35,111 --> 00:01:37,755
Are you going to,
I mean, you know,

36
00:01:37,802 --> 00:01:39,702
is this the first part
of some magic trick?

37
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:41,859
I don't do magic,
Morty, I do science.

38
00:01:41,906 --> 00:01:43,972
One takes brains, the other
takes dark eye liner.

39
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:45,963
Well, can you move?
Can you fly?

40
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,633
I wouldn't be much
of a pickle if I could.

41
00:01:47,668 --> 00:01:50,768
All right, well, do pickles
live forever or...

42
00:01:50,826 --> 00:01:53,729
Morty, stop digging for hidden
layers and just be impressed.

43
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,439
I'm a pickle.
I-I'm just trying

44
00:01:55,486 --> 00:01:56,966
to figure out
why you would do this...

45
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:58,542
Why anyone would do this.

46
00:01:58,589 --> 00:02:00,889
The reason anyone would
do this is, if they could,

47
00:02:00,928 --> 00:02:03,050
which they can't,
would be because they could,

48
00:02:03,086 --> 00:02:04,135
which they can't.

49
00:02:04,171 --> 00:02:06,275
Morty, we have to get going,
or we're gonna be late.

50
00:02:06,311 --> 00:02:08,168
- Where's your grandpa?
- Right here, sweetie.

51
00:02:08,204 --> 00:02:09,619
I'm a pickle! What?!

52
00:02:09,655 --> 00:02:11,018
Why would you... ugh!

53
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:12,739
Look, we're running late.
We have to go.

54
00:02:12,775 --> 00:02:14,034
Where are you guys going?

55
00:02:14,151 --> 00:02:16,493
We have an appointment
downtown

56
00:02:16,529 --> 00:02:19,288
that was set a week ago
and agreed upon by everyone,

57
00:02:19,335 --> 00:02:20,362
including you.

58
00:02:20,398 --> 00:02:23,621
Oh, my God. Beth, oh,
it totally slipped my mind.

59
00:02:23,691 --> 00:02:25,769
Geez, oh, man.
I'm a pickle.

60
00:02:25,823 --> 00:02:27,855
I mean, I don't know
if I can... ooh, geez.

61
00:02:27,891 --> 00:02:30,686
Rick, did you do this on purpose
to get out of family counseling?

62
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,110
- Morty!
- It's okay, Beth.

63
00:02:32,146 --> 00:02:33,622
I understand
Morty's suspicion.

64
00:02:33,669 --> 00:02:35,118
I've misled him before.

65
00:02:35,266 --> 00:02:37,860
Morty, turn me so we're
making eye contact.

66
00:02:38,383 --> 00:02:41,602
Morty, I assure you,
I would never find a way

67
00:02:41,665 --> 00:02:43,508
to get out of family therapy.

68
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:45,266
I hope my lack
of fingers doesn't prevent

69
00:02:45,302 --> 00:02:46,891
the perception
of my air quotes.

70
00:02:46,927 --> 00:02:48,782
Can't you just turn yourself
back into a human?

71
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:49,886
Great question, Summer.

72
00:02:49,922 --> 00:02:51,199
The unfortunate answer is

73
00:02:51,235 --> 00:02:52,719
I did this
to challenge myself.

74
00:02:52,762 --> 00:02:54,758
And it could take
hours or even days

75
00:02:54,797 --> 00:02:57,079
before I'm able to figure out
how to return to human form.

76
00:02:57,165 --> 00:02:59,074
But, I mean, you know,
your mom could put me

77
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,404
in a purse or a pocket,
you know,

78
00:03:00,451 --> 00:03:01,505
if she really needs me to go.

79
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,949
Nobody needs anything.
Okay, it's fine.

80
00:03:03,985 --> 00:03:05,605
I mean, you should just
stay here and figure out

81
00:03:05,641 --> 00:03:06,955
how to stop being
a pickle, okay?

82
00:03:07,002 --> 00:03:09,892
Hey, Rick, why is there
a syringe of mysterious fluid

83
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,360
hanging directly over you?

84
00:03:11,396 --> 00:03:13,922
Also, why is the string
attached to it running through

85
00:03:13,976 --> 00:03:15,785
a pair of scissors
attached to a timer?

86
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,933
And why is the time set
to 10 minutes from now,

87
00:03:17,985 --> 00:03:20,930
exactly when we would
have left for therapy?

88
00:03:21,665 --> 00:03:23,855
Well, Morty, if you know
must know,

89
00:03:23,891 --> 00:03:26,496
the syringe is completely
unrelated to this discussion,

90
00:03:26,532 --> 00:03:28,522
and, therefore, it does not
warrant further explanation.

91
00:03:28,557 --> 00:03:31,180
Enough. Kids, it's time to go.
We don't want to be late.

92
00:03:31,227 --> 00:03:32,766
W-W-What are you
doing there, Beth?

93
00:03:32,802 --> 00:03:33,931
W-W-What are you doing there,
sweetie?

94
00:03:33,966 --> 00:03:35,804
Well, I mean, you don't
want to get pierced by a needle

95
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:37,852
full of liquid unrelated
to your situation.

96
00:03:37,888 --> 00:03:38,888
How's that gonna help?

97
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:40,425
Can't argue with that.

98
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:41,844
Great. We'll see you later.

99
00:03:41,883 --> 00:03:43,020
Hey, hey,
be careful with that.

100
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:44,322
It's for something else.

101
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:45,297
It's really important,

102
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,998
so don't break it.

103
00:03:47,571 --> 00:03:49,844
Okay, I may have
up here.

104
00:03:51,411 --> 00:03:54,436
Dup, ap, ap, pap, ut,
dah, pap, pap, pap, pah.

105
00:03:54,483 --> 00:03:56,038
T-t-tah, tah.

106
00:04:06,395 --> 00:04:08,671
Oh, great.

107
00:04:09,025 --> 00:04:10,447
Stupid cat.

108
00:04:12,243 --> 00:04:13,779
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
I know what it looks like

109
00:04:13,814 --> 00:04:15,212
to you, Izzy,
but I'm not a snake!

110
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:17,256
I've seen the YouTube videos,
I know cats are scared

111
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,084
of cucumbers and pickles because
they think they're snakes.

112
00:04:19,119 --> 00:04:20,136
I'm not a snake!

113
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:22,030
I'm a pickle, I'm a pickle!

114
00:04:22,077 --> 00:04:23,098
Whoa!

115
00:04:23,145 --> 00:04:25,434
Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

116
00:04:26,937 --> 00:04:29,722
Oh, crap, that sun is bright.

117
00:04:30,447 --> 00:04:31,668
Okay, come on.

118
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:33,131
This can't really be
the way I go out.

119
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,743
This is the mega-genius
equivalent

120
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,011
of dying on the toilet.

121
00:04:37,783 --> 00:04:40,448
So hot.

122
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:42,878
This is how I'm gonna die.

123
00:04:52,162 --> 00:04:54,269
Oh, God, moisture.

124
00:04:54,534 --> 00:04:56,787
Oh, God, the moisture...
Dial it back, God.

125
00:04:56,847 --> 00:04:58,722
Dial it back a little bit here!

126
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,121
Oh! Oh.

127
00:05:03,477 --> 00:05:04,498
Oh, God!

128
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,542
Perpendicular, perpendicular!

129
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:08,210
Oh, shit!

130
00:05:08,257 --> 00:05:10,212
Oh! Oh!

131
00:05:18,099 --> 00:05:20,232
Oh! Ahoh!

132
00:05:27,957 --> 00:05:29,724
Come on. That's it.

133
00:05:29,823 --> 00:05:31,589
Come get this delicious brine.

134
00:05:31,847 --> 00:05:32,982
Aah!

135
00:05:35,111 --> 00:05:37,112
- Come on!
- Come on, mother-!

136
00:05:37,152 --> 00:05:38,740
Come on!

137
00:05:59,388 --> 00:06:01,585
Yes!

138
00:06:01,632 --> 00:06:03,779
How is this even
family therapy

139
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:06,144
if Dad's not invited
and Grandpa won't come?

140
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,514
Yeah, and what's courageous
about eating a hot dog?

141
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,756
It's nobody's choice
to be here, you knobs.

142
00:06:10,792 --> 00:06:13,482
The family was told to get
counseling by your principal,

143
00:06:13,518 --> 00:06:15,263
even though it's not
the family that was

144
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:17,592
huffing pottery glaze
in the art room

145
00:06:17,681 --> 00:06:19,714
and desk wetting
in history class.

146
00:06:20,206 --> 00:06:21,506
Oh, the Smith family,

147
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,740
minus a dad.

148
00:06:22,776 --> 00:06:24,509
You're patients
of Dr. Wong, too?

149
00:06:24,545 --> 00:06:26,568
Temporarily...
By order of the school.

150
00:06:26,604 --> 00:06:29,763
Me too. How long have
you all been eating poop?

151
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:32,638
We... have never...

152
00:06:32,701 --> 00:06:33,674
eaten poop.

153
00:06:33,717 --> 00:06:35,526
Uh, me, neither.

154
00:06:35,623 --> 00:06:38,428
Say, where did my family
get off to?

155
00:06:38,818 --> 00:06:40,702
Smith family,
I'm Dr. Wong.

156
00:06:40,738 --> 00:06:42,224
Come on in.

157
00:06:46,263 --> 00:06:48,977
I was told there was a grandpa
that might be joining us?

158
00:06:49,092 --> 00:06:51,310
He got wrapped up
in an experiment.

159
00:06:51,443 --> 00:06:53,003
He's a scientist.

160
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,423
Like, legit,
like on a an inter-galactic,

161
00:06:55,459 --> 00:06:57,029
sci-fi level.
His work is very...

162
00:06:57,065 --> 00:06:58,346
He turned himself
into a pickle.

163
00:06:58,381 --> 00:07:00,467
Morty, Mom's talking.
I'm sorry.

164
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,298
I suppose that's a good segue

165
00:07:02,334 --> 00:07:04,638
into our little
discipline cases here.

166
00:07:04,742 --> 00:07:07,451
Does Grandpa turn himself
into a pickle a lot?

167
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:10,654
What?! No!
What kind of question is that?

168
00:07:10,701 --> 00:07:13,506
The kind that wasn't designed to
attack or hurt you in any way.

169
00:07:13,607 --> 00:07:15,959
Oh, Jesus Christ,
one of these.

170
00:07:16,045 --> 00:07:19,545
No, my father has never turned
himself into a pickle before.

171
00:07:19,581 --> 00:07:21,625
He's unpredictable
and eccentric.

172
00:07:21,685 --> 00:07:24,154
The whole family is.
Speaking of which...

173
00:07:24,248 --> 00:07:27,049
Okay, let's open things up
to the whole family,

174
00:07:27,096 --> 00:07:28,795
and let me ask this.

175
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:32,678
Why do we think Grandpa
turned himself into a pickle?

176
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,326
Wow. Ugh!

177
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:48,545
Hey, listen, I know this
is your world not mine.

178
00:07:48,581 --> 00:07:50,549
The sooner I can get out,
the sooner I can go back

179
00:07:50,584 --> 00:07:54,013
to taking big craps, and you can
go back to subsisting on them.

180
00:07:54,456 --> 00:07:56,144
You are one driven rat.

181
00:07:56,271 --> 00:08:00,182
Could you be
a little more driven?

182
00:08:00,218 --> 00:08:02,163
To the right.

183
00:08:03,287 --> 00:08:04,646
Yes, yes, yes!

184
00:08:04,682 --> 00:08:06,849
Come on, come on, come on!
Fresh, fresh, fresh!

185
00:08:07,102 --> 00:08:09,057
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
was this your friend?

186
00:08:09,104 --> 00:08:12,709
Don't worry, he died doing what
he loved, being a dumb... rat.

187
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:21,737
♪

188
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,172
Oh, yeah!

189
00:08:58,487 --> 00:08:59,696
Aaaah!

190
00:09:00,155 --> 00:09:01,712
I didn't say
my father is perfect,

191
00:09:01,748 --> 00:09:03,228
I said his work is important.

192
00:09:03,264 --> 00:09:04,941
And she's saying
what's important is

193
00:09:05,004 --> 00:09:07,104
that Grandpa lied to you
to get out of coming here.

194
00:09:07,229 --> 00:09:08,118
Oh, he did not!

195
00:09:08,154 --> 00:09:09,642
Let's do an experiment here.

196
00:09:09,771 --> 00:09:11,871
I get the impression
this family values science.

197
00:09:12,267 --> 00:09:14,389
So raise your hand
if you feel certain

198
00:09:14,436 --> 00:09:16,657
you know what was
in the syringe.

199
00:09:17,501 --> 00:09:19,790
Raise your hand if
you know for certain

200
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:23,275
the syringe does not
contain anti-pickle serum.

201
00:09:24,603 --> 00:09:26,289
Beth, your hand did
a little thing there.

202
00:09:26,336 --> 00:09:27,926
Do you really not see
what's happening here?

203
00:09:27,961 --> 00:09:29,548
Tell me. Well, Dr. Wong...

204
00:09:29,642 --> 00:09:31,106
By the way, racist name...

205
00:09:31,175 --> 00:09:33,375
Obviously, Morty and Summer
are seizing on your

206
00:09:33,411 --> 00:09:35,618
arbitrary pickle obsession
as an end run

207
00:09:35,654 --> 00:09:37,860
around what was supposed
to be<i> their</i> therapy.

208
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,564
Oh, I think
this pickle incident

209
00:09:39,634 --> 00:09:41,228
is a better path
than any other

210
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,073
to the heart of
your family's dysfunction.

211
00:09:43,189 --> 00:09:45,173
I think it's possible
that you and your father

212
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,329
have a very specific dynamic.

213
00:09:47,397 --> 00:09:48,525
I don't think it's one

214
00:09:48,561 --> 00:09:50,509
that rewards emotion
or vulnerability.

215
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,868
I think it may punish them.

216
00:09:51,904 --> 00:09:54,384
I think it's possible that
dynamic eroded your marriage,

217
00:09:54,525 --> 00:09:56,275
and is infecting
your kids with a tendency

218
00:09:56,311 --> 00:09:58,423
to misdirect their feelings.

219
00:09:58,915 --> 00:09:59,969
you.

220
00:10:00,005 --> 00:10:01,017
- Mom!
- Mom!

221
00:10:01,053 --> 00:10:02,152
both of you, too.

222
00:10:04,446 --> 00:10:06,252
By the way, you might
notice that in spite of

223
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:08,251
your numerous
distinctive features,

224
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,812
I never gave you a name
like Scar or Stripe or Goliath.

225
00:10:12,216 --> 00:10:14,189
That's because, to me,
you aren't special.

226
00:10:14,227 --> 00:10:16,376
You were special to rats.
Now they're dead.

227
00:10:16,501 --> 00:10:18,520
I guess it was me
you should have impressed.

228
00:10:19,001 --> 00:10:21,289
God damn it, I love myself.

229
00:10:31,384 --> 00:10:33,343
Pickle Rick!

230
00:10:47,634 --> 00:10:48,814
Get that parkour.

231
00:10:48,927 --> 00:10:50,360
Get that parkour!

232
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,079
- Aah!
- Hey, it's cool.

233
00:10:55,115 --> 00:10:56,715
Just need to find
the nearest exit.

234
00:10:56,751 --> 00:10:58,417
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
No need to freak out.

235
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,451
Whoa!

236
00:11:02,349 --> 00:11:04,637
Who in the toilet
is this?

237
00:11:11,176 --> 00:11:12,363
What is it?

238
00:11:12,432 --> 00:11:14,850
A pickle? A rat? Both.

239
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,615
It says it's a scientist.

240
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:17,914
Where is it?

241
00:11:17,961 --> 00:11:19,794
It seems to be
using the air ducts

242
00:11:19,841 --> 00:11:21,566
and the mail tubes
to get around.

243
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:24,032
It's been gathering
office supplies, we think,

244
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,233
to build weaponry.

245
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,331
But look what it
did on the mezzanine.

246
00:11:27,683 --> 00:11:31,940
It transferred a bottle from
the trash to the recycling bin.

247
00:11:32,222 --> 00:11:35,338
Whatever this thing is,
it's shaming us.

248
00:11:35,491 --> 00:11:37,758
We have 34 armed guards,
and we can't kill a pickle?

249
00:11:37,993 --> 00:11:40,072
32 armed guards.

250
00:11:40,197 --> 00:11:41,705
He killed two.

251
00:11:41,752 --> 00:11:43,103
It's on the phone.

252
00:11:43,181 --> 00:11:45,860
Put him on, and locate
the phone he's using.

253
00:11:45,994 --> 00:11:47,290
Hello.

254
00:11:47,326 --> 00:11:50,195
<i>Hi, um, can you, uh,
please let me out.</i>

255
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:51,955
Your mere presence
in this building

256
00:11:52,088 --> 00:11:53,783
violates international law.

257
00:11:53,861 --> 00:11:56,829
<i>I couldn't let you out even
if you hadn't killed two men.</i>

258
00:11:56,907 --> 00:11:59,289
You should know
those men killed themselves.

259
00:11:59,345 --> 00:12:00,688
<i>And how is that?</i>

260
00:12:00,908 --> 00:12:02,822
<i>They didn't
let me out.</i>

261
00:12:02,858 --> 00:12:03,942
Solen'ya.

262
00:12:03,978 --> 00:12:05,218
Shut your mouth
and do your jobs,

263
00:12:05,253 --> 00:12:06,630
you children!

264
00:12:06,677 --> 00:12:08,243
Uh, is this not
a good time or...?

265
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:11,305
Some of my men
are calling you "Solen'ya"...

266
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,172
The Pickle Man,
an old wives tale.

267
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,072
He crawls from
bowls of cold soup

268
00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:18,174
to steal the dreams
of wasteful children.

269
00:12:18,221 --> 00:12:19,696
<i>That'd be
a lucky break for you.</i>

270
00:12:19,732 --> 00:12:21,804
Go, shoot to kill.

271
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,085
Aaah!

272
00:12:35,987 --> 00:12:37,065
We got him.

273
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,137
- Ah.
- Ah.

274
00:12:38,173 --> 00:12:39,199
<i> Because this pickle</i>

275
00:12:39,235 --> 00:12:41,387
<i>doesn't care
about your children.</i>

276
00:12:41,848 --> 00:12:43,512
And I'm not gonna
take their dreams.

277
00:12:43,575 --> 00:12:45,716
I'm gonna take their parents.

278
00:13:03,174 --> 00:13:05,021
Solen'ya! He's coming!

279
00:13:05,068 --> 00:13:07,908
It's because I threw
half-way my sandwich!

280
00:13:08,049 --> 00:13:09,437
He's just a pickle!

281
00:13:09,484 --> 00:13:10,650
He's a monster.

282
00:13:10,719 --> 00:13:12,666
He's not the only one.

283
00:13:21,794 --> 00:13:25,154
You can stay, dead to the world
and die in this room.

284
00:13:25,693 --> 00:13:29,685
Or you can kill a pickle for me
and earn your freedom.

285
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,599
There is no freedom while
you're leader breathes.

286
00:13:33,717 --> 00:13:35,739
Our country is a prison.

287
00:13:35,927 --> 00:13:37,662
Then Catarina is a prisoner.

288
00:13:37,729 --> 00:13:40,262
Perhaps I could arrange
her escape, as well.

289
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:43,854
She lives, Jaguar.

290
00:13:44,076 --> 00:13:46,290
Where is this pickle?

291
00:13:46,544 --> 00:13:48,826
What do you think is
in the syringe, Beth?

292
00:13:48,873 --> 00:13:51,243
You're the one that costs
$200 an hour. You tell me.

293
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,932
- Anti-pickle serum.
- It's anti-pickle serum.

294
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:55,978
Your kids think it might be
anti-pickle serum.

295
00:13:56,025 --> 00:13:59,560
My kids pee their desks
and suck on unbaked vases.

296
00:13:59,662 --> 00:14:01,954
They're just angry at me
for divorcing their father.

297
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,307
I never said
I was angry at you.

298
00:14:03,354 --> 00:14:05,721
That's the point of
pottery-enamel huffing, Summer.

299
00:14:05,768 --> 00:14:07,255
You do it so you
don't have to say

300
00:14:07,307 --> 00:14:09,177
"I'm angry at mommy"
out loud.

301
00:14:09,305 --> 00:14:10,568
Oh, my God! Oh, there...

302
00:14:10,693 --> 00:14:13,173
There's pictures of people
eating poop in there!

303
00:14:13,209 --> 00:14:16,887
It's not my job to take
sides or pass judgment.

304
00:14:17,021 --> 00:14:19,466
Do you think when your father
asks for that syringe,

305
00:14:19,502 --> 00:14:21,860
you could ask him... He won't
have to ask for it, okay?

306
00:14:21,896 --> 00:14:22,805
He won't need it.

307
00:14:22,852 --> 00:14:23,990
He'll just make more.

308
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:26,123
He doesn't<i> need</i>
anything from anyone.

309
00:14:26,373 --> 00:14:28,685
You admire him for that.

310
00:14:29,465 --> 00:14:30,953
It's better than
making your problems

311
00:14:30,993 --> 00:14:32,248
other people's problems.

312
00:14:49,804 --> 00:14:50,923
Oh, come on!

313
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,935
Pickle Man, you should
know this isn't personal!

314
00:15:04,982 --> 00:15:06,373
You should know
that isn't original.

315
00:15:06,408 --> 00:15:07,505
They have my daughter.

316
00:15:07,552 --> 00:15:09,580
There's nothing I won't do
to see her again.

317
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:12,009
Yeah, there's lots I<i> wouldn't</i> do
to see my daughter,

318
00:15:12,056 --> 00:15:13,823
but killing you gets me
to her quicker

319
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,858
than your derivative
bullshit.

320
00:15:20,431 --> 00:15:22,486
I never bullshit, Pickle Man.

321
00:15:22,549 --> 00:15:24,642
This can only end
with one of us dead,

322
00:15:24,728 --> 00:15:26,257
and I have never died.

323
00:15:26,304 --> 00:15:27,861
That will be your
downfall, Jaguar,

324
00:15:27,897 --> 00:15:30,869
not being open
to new experiences.

325
00:15:42,119 --> 00:15:43,586
Is it done?

326
00:15:43,932 --> 00:15:45,376
Jaguar?!

327
00:15:45,533 --> 00:15:47,389
<i>Jaguar couldn't make it.</i>

328
00:15:47,498 --> 00:15:48,541
Do it.

329
00:15:48,705 --> 00:15:50,721
Okay, you win, Pickle Man.

330
00:15:50,793 --> 00:15:52,092
I'm unsealing the building.

331
00:15:52,162 --> 00:15:54,189
<i>No, thanks.
I'm coming for you now.</i>

332
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:57,557
Pickle Man, there's
$100 million worth of bonds

333
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:58,923
in a safe on level two.

334
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,135
I'll give you
the combination.

335
00:16:00,182 --> 00:16:01,992
That money belongs
to the people.

336
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:04,189
Shut up and call me
a helicopter, you prick!

337
00:16:04,244 --> 00:16:05,478
Do we have a deal?!

338
00:16:05,557 --> 00:16:07,569
<i>Take that money,
give it to Jaguar's daughter</i>

339
00:16:07,605 --> 00:16:08,647
<i>when you set her free.</i>

340
00:16:08,683 --> 00:16:09,853
Or I'll be visiting you.

341
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:11,310
<i>Jaguar's daughter is dead.</i>

342
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:12,724
Huh, so you're a liar.

343
00:16:12,787 --> 00:16:14,138
<i>Jaguar was an animal.</i>

344
00:16:14,185 --> 00:16:15,918
You're an intelligent pickle.

345
00:16:15,965 --> 00:16:17,178
We can do business.

346
00:16:17,214 --> 00:16:19,134
<i>I don't think so.
See you soon.</i>

347
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,767
- Is the helicopter here?
- Yes.

348
00:16:20,803 --> 00:16:22,076
And the police
are on the way.

an expression

365

of familiarity over time,
my access to infinite timelines

366

precludes the necessity
of attachment.

367
00:17:16,314 --> 00:17:18,846

it's because my family sucks.

I am sad...

388
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:05,149
that I peed.

389
00:18:05,207 --> 00:18:08,811
I-I-I'm sad that I peed in class
instead of a toilet.

390

Look at this family go.
You guys are pros.

391

392
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,678
Ugh.

- You must be Rick.
- Mm-hmm.

394
00:18:27,404 --> 00:18:29,128
I've heard a lot
about you today.

395
00:18:29,164 --> 00:18:31,141
Your family
is crazy about you.

396
00:18:31,207 --> 00:18:33,349
Your daughter holds you
in very high regard.

397
00:18:33,389 --> 00:18:34,361
You're a lucky fella.

398
00:18:34,397 --> 00:18:36,258
Yeah, thank you.
Uh, sweetie, you don't still

399
00:18:36,305 --> 00:18:38,569
happen to have that
syringe in your purse?

400
00:18:41,946 --> 00:18:43,420
Dad...

401
00:18:43,524 --> 00:18:47,946
I would like you to tell me
what's in the syringe.

402
00:18:48,047 --> 00:18:51,977
It's a serum that I need to,
uh, to stay alive.

403
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:55,125
I have had a rough day.

404
00:18:55,212 --> 00:18:58,469
And, uh, I've sustained
a lot of damage.

405
00:18:58,516 --> 00:19:01,250
I'm pretty close to death,
which the serum will prevent.

406
00:19:01,297 --> 00:19:04,201
By changing you from
a pickle to a human.

407
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:05,573
Yes.

408
00:19:05,663 --> 00:19:08,216
Rick, why did you lie
to your daughter?

409
00:19:09,334 --> 00:19:10,571
So I wouldn't
have to come here.

410
00:19:10,606 --> 00:19:12,216
Why didn't you want
to come here?

411
00:19:12,263 --> 00:19:14,920
Because I don't respect therapy,
because I'm a scientist.

412
00:19:14,982 --> 00:19:17,138
Because I invent, transform,
create, and destroy

413
00:19:17,177 --> 00:19:18,190
for a living, and when
I don't like something

414
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:19,931
about the world, I change it.

415
00:19:19,978 --> 00:19:22,149
And I don't think going to
a rented office in a strip mall

416
00:19:22,184 --> 00:19:23,994
to listen to some
agent of averageness

417
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,848
explain which words
mean which feelings

418
00:19:25,884 --> 00:19:27,337
has ever helped
anyone do anything.

419
00:19:27,415 --> 00:19:29,041
I think it's helped a lot
of people get comfortable

420
00:19:29,076 --> 00:19:31,168
and stop panicking,
which is a state of mind

421
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:32,986
we value
in the animals we eat,

422
00:19:33,022 --> 00:19:34,633
but not something
I want for myself.

423
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:35,828
I'm not a cow.

424
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:38,053
I'm a pickle...
When I feel like it.

425
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,611
So... you asked.

426
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:43,113
Rick, the only
connection between

427
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,394
your unquestionable
intelligence and the sickness

428
00:19:45,441 --> 00:19:48,330
destroying your family
is that everyone in your family,

429
00:19:48,377 --> 00:19:51,685
you included, use intelligence
to justify sickness.

430
00:19:51,912 --> 00:19:54,626
You seem to alternate
between viewing your own mind

431
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:58,328
as an unstoppable force
and as an inescapable curse.

432
00:19:58,375 --> 00:19:59,998
And I think
it's because the only

433
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,166
truly unapproachable
concept for you

434
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:04,857
is that it's your mind
within your control.

435
00:20:05,013 --> 00:20:07,724
You chose to come here,
you chose to talk

436
00:20:07,912 --> 00:20:11,748
to belittle my vocation, just as
you chose to become a pickle.

437
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,007
You are the master
of your universe,

438
00:20:14,062 --> 00:20:16,595
and yet you are dripping
with rat blood and feces.

439
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,990
Your enormous mind literally
vegetating by your own hand.

440
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:22,779
I have no doubt that
you would be bored senseless

441
00:20:22,815 --> 00:20:25,717
by therapy, the same way
I'm bored when I brush my teeth

442
00:20:25,756 --> 00:20:26,818
and wipe my ass.

443
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,466
Because the thing
about repairing,

444
00:20:28,554 --> 00:20:32,266
maintaining, and cleaning is
it's not an adventure.

445
00:20:32,376 --> 00:20:34,682
There's no way to do it
so wrong you might die.

446
00:20:34,823 --> 00:20:36,346
It's just work.

447
00:20:36,382 --> 00:20:37,504
And the bottom line is,

448
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,839
some people are okay going
to work, and some people...

449
00:20:41,171 --> 00:20:43,336
well, some people
would rather die.

450
00:20:43,478 --> 00:20:45,806
Each of us gets to choose.

451
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:49,839
That's our time.

452
00:20:49,901 --> 00:20:51,415
I'm going to
give you guys my card

453
00:20:51,462 --> 00:20:52,629
and hope to hear
from you again.

454
00:20:52,664 --> 00:20:54,616
And if you have any friends
or family that eat poop

455
00:20:54,651 --> 00:20:57,132
and would like to stop,
give them my number.

456
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:01,221
I, um...

457
00:21:01,589 --> 00:21:03,438
I'm sorry I lied
to get out of the thing.

458
00:21:03,474 --> 00:21:04,660
I... I shouldn't lie to you.

459
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:05,750
Oh, it's fine.

460
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:08,113
I mean, thank you,
and, yeah, you shouldn't.

461
00:21:08,148 --> 00:21:09,932
But I hope you know
that's not what

462
00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:11,535

was supposed to be.

463
00:21:11,582 --> 00:21:14,268

it was Morty peeing his pants

464
00:21:14,323 --> 00:21:15,924
and Summer snorting glue
or whatever...

465
00:21:17,335 --> 00:21:19,995
She huffed enamel, and we never
even talked about it.

466
00:21:20,075 --> 00:21:21,413
Well, there was so much
more at stake.

467
00:21:22,718 --> 00:21:25,612
I mean, that shrink,
what a monologuist.

468
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:28,821

469
00:21:29,034 --> 00:21:31,133

Get that syringe now?
