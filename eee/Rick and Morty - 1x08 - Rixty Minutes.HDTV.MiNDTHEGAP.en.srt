1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,400
- <i>Cynthia...</ i>
- Oh, my God! No, no...

2
00:00:06,405 --> 00:00:08,205
- I told you!
- Hold on...

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:09,799
<i> Will you please... </ i>

4
00:00:10,144 --> 00:00:12,187
<i> NOT marry me?
I choose Veronica. </ I>

5
00:00:12,188 --> 00:00:13,121
- What?
- Yes!

6
00:00:13,122 --> 00:00:16,805
- Called it. - Why would he choose Veronica?
- Because he loves her.

7
00:00:16,806 --> 00:00:18,344
Well--if it's any consolation, Summer,

8
00:00:18,345 --> 00:00:20,592
none of it mattered, and
the entire show is stupid.

9
00:00:20,593 --> 00:00:22,055
Okay, I've got
an idea, Rick.

10
00:00:22,056 --> 00:00:25,889
You show us your concept of "good
TV," and we'll crap all over that.

11
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,232
I thought
you'd never ask.

12
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:29,233
Hey!

13
00:00:29,543 --> 00:00:33,531
Oh, cool! Is that crystallized Zanthonite?
It conducts electrons across dimensions.

14
00:00:33,532 --> 00:00:38,648
Twenty percent accurate, as usual, Morty.
The important thing being I just upgraded

15
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:41,248
our cable package with programming
from every conceivable reality.

16
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,912
Wait, does that mean we get
Showtime Extreme?

17
00:00:42,913 --> 00:00:45,984
How about Showtime Extreme in a
world where man evolved from corn.

18
00:00:45,985 --> 00:00:47,975
<i> We're not so different.
We're both corn of action. </ I>

19
00:00:47,976 --> 00:00:51,178
<i> Yeah. But one of
us is...DEAD CORN! </ i>

20
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:52,208
- Boring.
- Summer,

21
00:00:52,209 --> 00:00:55,426
You just spent three months,
watching a man choose a fake wife.

22
00:00:55,427 --> 00:00:58,169
So what? It'd be better if
the people were corn?

23
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,596
Jerry, you don't get it.
This is infinite TV...

24
00:01:00,597 --> 00:01:02,669
from infinite
universes. Look.

25
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,681
<i> This shit is delicious. </ i>

26
00:01:04,682 --> 00:01:06,169
A movie about a
guy eating shit.

27
00:01:07,325 --> 00:01:09,199
A violent
Antiques Show...

28
00:01:10,463 --> 00:01:12,778
- It's a pleasure to have you.
- The pleasure's all mine.

29
00:01:12,779 --> 00:01:15,204
Letterman from a
time line where Jerry's famous...

30
00:01:15,205 --> 00:01:16,803
- Wait!
- What in the hell?

31
00:01:16,804 --> 00:01:18,187
I agree.
Where is this going?

32
00:01:18,188 --> 00:01:19,843
No, the other thing!
Go back!

33
00:01:19,844 --> 00:01:21,358
Really?
All right, fine.

34
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:24,626
<i> Glenn, this is a court order.
It says you can't eat shit anymore. </ I>

35
00:01:25,601 --> 00:01:28,705
All right, Jerry, when you're right,
you're right. Now I'm hooked.

36
00:01:29,461 --> 00:01:31,961
Rick and Morty S01E08
''Rixty Minutes''

37
00:01:31,962 --> 00:01:34,462
Translated back from the Portuguese version

38
00:01:34,463 --> 00:01:36,963
by paulo loppes for addic7ed.com

39
00:02:00,962 --> 00:02:04,430
Coming up next on "Shmloo's 
the Shmloss," Shmlony has a nightmare.

40
00:02:04,431 --> 00:02:06,287
<i> Shmlantha, Schmlona! </ i>

41
00:02:06,288 --> 00:02:09,749
Amazing. A dimension where all
proper nouns begin with "Schmla."

42
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,764
<i> Schmlove,
Schmlandula, Schmlonathan ... </ i>

43
00:02:13,765 --> 00:02:15,951
All right, that got... th-that actually
got old pretty quick.

44
00:02:16,526 --> 00:02:20,636
Rick, would you please
go back to me on David Letterman?

45
00:02:20,637 --> 00:02:23,469
Infinity's a big number, Jerry.
I don't remember the channel.

46
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,270
- Go back, go back!
- Jeez...

47
00:02:25,275 --> 00:02:26,849
<i> You speak da tru-tru. </ i>

48
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,631
Oh my God!
Dad's in Cloud Atlas!

49
00:02:29,632 --> 00:02:32,241
I'm in Cloud Atlas!
What's Cloud Atlas?

50
00:02:32,242 --> 00:02:36,442
<i> Sometimes small tru-tru
different than da big tru-tru. </ i>

51
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,723
How is this possible?

52
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:42,108
Infinite time lines, infinite possibilities.
Including a time line where Jerry's a movie star.

53
00:02:42,109 --> 00:02:46,728
Look, you guys are getting excited about
the wrong aspect of this device. Wa--Look at this.

54
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:49,469
<i> And now, another
Quick Mystery. </ i>

55
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,046
<i> I just want to know who could've done
something like this. It's a travesty! </ I>

56
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:56,190
<i> I did. See this knife and all the blood
on it? Here's my fingerprints. </ I>

57
00:02:56,191 --> 00:02:58,069
<i> Guilty! I sentence you
to life in prison. </ I>

58
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,962
<i> - Here's another Quick Mystery.
- My mother's dead! </ i>

59
00:03:00,963 --> 00:03:04,887
<i> And I killed her. Here's the weapon.
And cuff me, thank you very much. </ I>

60
00:03:04,888 --> 00:03:06,551
<i> Guilty!
Sentenced to murder. </ i>

61
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:09,471
<i> - Here's another.
- I'm the killer! </ i>

62
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,639
<i> Wow, that one was really
quick, wasn't it? </ i>

63
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,491
Now who wants to watch random, 
crazy TV shows from different dimensions...

64
00:03:17,065 --> 00:03:20,711
a-a-and then who wants to narcissistically
obsess about their alternate self?

65
00:03:20,712 --> 00:03:22,293
- I want to obsess about myself.
- The narcisstic stuff.

66
00:03:23,394 --> 00:03:26,924
(Sigh) Here. These scan your retinas, and
let you view parallel time lines

67
00:03:26,925 --> 00:03:28,956
through genetically matching
versions of your eyes.

68
00:03:28,957 --> 00:03:29,984
Go fetch!

69
00:03:29,985 --> 00:03:31,341
- Yes! This is so cool!
- Ladies First!

70
00:03:32,061 --> 00:03:33,230
I'm proud of you, Morty.

71
00:03:33,231 --> 00:03:36,721
Hey man, I don't give a crap about myself, Rick. 
Let's watch some crazy stuff, yo!

72
00:03:36,974 --> 00:03:38,345
<i> I'm Ants-
In-My-Eyes Johnson, </ i>

73
00:03:38,346 --> 00:03:40,486
<i> Here at Ants-in-
My-Eyes Johnson's Electronics. </ i>

74
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:42,585
<i> I mean, there's so
many ants in my eyes! </ i>

75
00:03:42,586 --> 00:03:45,769
<i> And there's so many
TVs, microwaves, radios ... </ i>

76
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:50,714
<i> I think, I can't--I'm not 100% sure what we have
here in stock, because I can't see anything. </ i>

77
00:03:50,844 --> 00:03:53,459
<i> Our prices I
hope aren't too low! </ i>

78
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,074
<i> Check out this
refrigerator! Only $200! </ i>

79
00:03:56,075 --> 00:03:59,451
<i> What about this microwave?
Only $100! That's fair! </ I>

80
00:03:59,452 --> 00:04:03,581
<i> I'm Ants-in-My-Eyes Johnson!
Everything's black, I can't see a thing! </ I>

81
00:04:03,582 --> 00:04:06,332
<i> And also I can't feel anything either,
did I mention that? </ i>

82
00:04:06,335 --> 00:04:09,285
<i> But that's not as catchy
as having ants in your eyes. </ i>

83
00:04:09,286 --> 00:04:11,955
<i> So that always goes, you know,
off by the wayside. </ i>

84
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:14,144
<i> I can't feel.
It's a very rare disease. </ i>

85
00:04:14,145 --> 00:04:18,598
<i> All my s-- All my nerves,
they don't allow for the sensation of touch. </ i>

86
00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:21,889
<i> So I never know what's going on.
Am I standing? Sitting? I don't know. </ I>

87
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,811
Are we sure we want to do this?
Look at our own alternative lives?

88
00:04:24,812 --> 00:04:28,112
You're right. Maybe we should
just play Yahtzee. Give me those!

89
00:04:29,063 --> 00:04:33,297
- What do you see?
- Whiteness. Pure whiteness.

90
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,310
You're my best friend, Jerry Smith.
I love doing cocaine with you.

91
00:04:38,315 --> 00:04:41,953
Whoa... I love doing cocaine
with you too, Johnny Depp!

92
00:04:42,164 --> 00:04:43,993
Haven't we spent enough
time on you?

93
00:04:45,448 --> 00:04:47,282
I'm performing surgery...

94
00:04:47,283 --> 00:04:49,637
but not on a horse,
on a human!

95
00:04:49,638 --> 00:04:53,077
That's great, Beth! You always wanted to
be a real surgeon.

96
00:04:53,244 --> 00:04:55,484
I am a real surgeon.

97
00:04:55,956 --> 00:04:57,659
- Ahh--uh...Summer's turn!
- Finally!

98
00:04:59,356 --> 00:05:00,396
I don't see anything.

99
00:05:00,397 --> 00:05:02,409
Well, you should select a
different timeline,

100
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,357
I mean, if your father and I
achieved our dreams,

101
00:05:04,358 --> 00:05:05,872
there's a chance
you weren't even born.

102
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:09,008
That came out wrong.
That came out very wrong.

103
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:12,178
Fine, I'll find a world
where you bothered to have me.

104
00:05:15,555 --> 00:05:17,126
We're playing Yahtzee.

105
00:05:17,127 --> 00:05:20,643
- Yahtzee's fun. We love Yahtzee.
- It's a fun game for fun families!

106
00:05:20,644 --> 00:05:22,800
Hey, could I get those goggles back
for a second?

107
00:05:22,801 --> 00:05:29,386
<i> It's a 45 horsepower with anti-lock brakes, and it's
the official car of Mr. Sneezy 3D. </ i>

108
00:05:29,387 --> 00:05:32,531
<i> It's the brand-new... Sneezy XL. </ i>

00:05:40,292 --> 00:05:43,354
<i> Deezy... Mc... Deluxe. </ i>

112
00:05:43,355 --> 00:05:45,455
<i> Oh, I'm Mr. Sneezy!
Achoo! </ I>

113
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,476
Huh, seems like TV from other dimensions
has a somewhat looser feel to it.

114
00:05:49,477 --> 00:05:52,295
Yeah, it's got an almost
improvisational tone.

115
00:05:52,296 --> 00:05:54,705
<i> It's in theaters now!
Coming this summer: </ i>

116
00:05:54,706 --> 00:05:58,854
<i> Two brothers. In a van. And
then a meteor hit. </ i>

117
00:05:58,855 --> 00:06:03,166
<i> and they ran as fast as they could...
from giant cat monsters. </ i>

118
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:09,767
<i> and then a giant tornado came...

<i> A Mexican armada

<i> with weapons made from To-...tomatoes.
And you better bet your bottom dollar... </ i>

121
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:22,078
<i> that these two brothers know
how to handle business. </ i>

122

124
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,300

these two brothers. </ i>

128
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,727
But let's get back to
the brothers, because

129
00:06:47,753 --> 00:06:49,739
they're...they have a strong
bond.

130
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,435
<i> You don't want to know about it here,
but I'll tell you one thing: The moon... </ i>

<i> ...it comes crashing into Earth.

133
00:07:00,077 --> 00:07:03,743
Two brothers... Two brothers!
It's just called Two Brothers.

134
00:07:03,744 --> 00:07:06,341
Holy crap, I am
winning a Nobel Prize.

135
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:08,025
Come on!
Time's up!

136
00:07:08,453 --> 00:07:10,098
I'm taming a lion!

137
00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:14,712
No, wait, uh...there are film cameras. I
might be a lion-tamer in a movie.

138
00:07:14,713 --> 00:07:16,583
You get the idea.
I work with lions.

139
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:23,128
Ooh, we're not playing Yahtzee,
we're playing Chutes and Ladders.

140
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:27,685
It seems like when I exist, life gets a
little more, I don't know...predictable?

141
00:07:27,686 --> 00:07:30,120
When two people 
create a life together,

142
00:07:30,121 --> 00:07:33,120
they set aside their 
previous lives as individuals.

143
00:07:33,121 --> 00:07:37,121
Gimme a break! We're not heroes for
having unprotected sex on prom night.

144
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:40,329
Oh, I get it. Now that you know
you could have had it better,

145
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:43,467
you resent me
for holding you back.

146
00:07:43,468 --> 00:07:45,659
Now that we know you think the tables
are turning,

147
00:07:45,685 --> 00:07:47,875
we know you thought
there were unturned tables!

148
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,604
- What are you talking about?
- All this time, you've been thinking,

149
00:07:50,605 --> 00:07:53,475
"What if that loser Jerry hadn't
talked me out of the abortion?"

150
00:07:53,656 --> 00:07:55,807
Well now you know, you'd be a doctor.
Whoop-dee-doo.

151
00:07:56,638 --> 00:08:00,481
You'd also be drinking wine, alone in
a house full of exotic birds.

152
00:08:00,482 --> 00:08:04,155
And I'd be on DiCaprio's yacht,
banging Kristen Stewart!

153
00:08:04,156 --> 00:08:05,615
You thought about 
getting an abortion?

154
00:08:05,616 --> 00:08:09,429
Everyone thinks about it. Obviously, I'm
the version of me that didn't do it.

155
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:12,290
- So...you're welcome.
- Yeah, you're welcome.

156
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,914
Yeah, thank you guys SO much. It's
a real treat to be raised by parents

157
00:08:15,915 --> 00:08:19,242
that force themselves to be together
instead of being happy.

158
00:08:19,243 --> 00:08:20,791
Hey, do we have any wafer cookies?

159
00:08:22,956 --> 00:08:26,391
Oh, boy. Looks like you guys have been checking
out alternate lives and realizing

160
00:08:26,392 --> 00:08:30,095
you don't have it as good, huh? That's too bad.
You know, me and Morty are having a blast,

161
00:08:30,096 --> 00:08:32,425
We just discovered a show
called "Ball Fondlers."

162
00:08:32,426 --> 00:08:36,713
I mean, I don't want to rub it in or anything,
but you guys clearly backed the wrong conceptual horse.

163
00:08:41,718 --> 00:08:42,860
BALL Fondlers

164
00:08:49,514 --> 00:08:52,114
- I'm in Heaven right now.
- This might be the best day of my life.

165
00:08:52,307 --> 00:08:53,566
So now what do we do?

166
00:08:53,829 --> 00:08:56,036
That show "Ball Fondlers"
sounded kind of interesting.

167
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:57,306
- Dad!
- What?

168
00:08:57,307 --> 00:08:59,940
They're having fun in there!
What do you guys want from me?

169
00:08:59,941 --> 00:09:03,530
Every family on this block has to
wonder if they're together by choice.

170
00:09:03,531 --> 00:09:07,831
Our family just has inter-dimensional goggles
to show us for a fact that we're not.

171
00:09:07,835 --> 00:09:10,515
- We'll I'm leaving!
- You can't leave, you're 17!

172
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:12,266
Yeah, and I'm not pregnant.

173
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:15,011
I'm gonna have better judgment
than you guys had at my age.

174
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:20,395
I'm gonna...move to the southwest and...
I don't know, do something with turquoise.

175
00:09:21,076 --> 00:09:24,427
<i> It's Saturday Night Live! </ i>

year: Bobby Moynihan! </ i>

183
00:09:51,111 --> 00:09:54,926
Interesting fun fact, uh, Moynihan and
piece of toast hate each other.

184
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,484
Apparently they've got some real
creative differences.

185
00:09:57,719 --> 00:10:04,219
Hey, are you tired of real doors, cluttering up your
house, where you open 'em, and they actually go somewhere
And you go in another room?

186
00:10:04,225 --> 00:10:07,866
<i> Get on down to "Real Fake Doors"!

Hey wait a minute, Rick. I thought this
was a commercial. W-What's going on? I mean--

192
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,770
Relax, Morty. Don't-Don't worry about it--
Let's just--just see where this goes.

193
00:10:37,856 --> 00:10:40,437
<i> Step on it, we
all got places to be! </ i>

00:10:44,175 --> 00:10:47,139
See, that must be where 
he lives...OK.

196
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,930
Huh. Making himself a 
sandwich now...

197
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:56,243
<i> Hey everybody!
So this is my house, </ I>

It's still the commercial!

201
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:05,318

- Wait wait, Rick! Hold on.

<i> What are you worried about?

Okay, okay,

<i> I hate Mumunmunundsdays. And I

215
00:11:36,802 --> 00:11:37,927
Hey Rick, that's pretty cool!

216
00:11:37,928 --> 00:11:40,720
It's just like Garfield, only
instead, it's Gazorpazorpfield.

217
00:11:40,721 --> 00:11:44,655
Hey, isn't Gazorpazorp where uh... where
those Sex robots came from, remember?

218
00:11:44,656 --> 00:11:48,856
- That whole thing? - Yeah...hey, that's
pretty, pretty...that's true.

219
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:52,118
-That's right! -Yeah. Let's watch some more
Gazorpazorpfield!

220
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:54,091
<i> Hey Jon, it's me,
Gazorpazorpfield. </ i>

221
00:11:54,092 --> 00:11:58,398
<i> Boy. [BLEEP] you, Jon. You [BLEEP] 
dumb, stupid, idiot. </ I>

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,202
<i> Come on,Gazorpazorpfield, 
go easy on me, huh? </ I>

223
00:12:01,203 --> 00:12:07,703
<i> You dumb, stupid, weak,
pathetic, white, white... uh, uh... </ i>

224
00:12:08,536 --> 00:12:14,161
<i> ...Guilt, white guilt,
milquetoast piece of human garbage. </ I>

thats, you know... </ i>

226
00:12:16,122 --> 00:12:18,197
<i> you're pretty mean to me,
but that takes the cake. </ i>

227
00:12:18,198 --> 00:12:22,111
I don't give a [BLEEP]!
I'm Gazorpazorp-[BLEEP]-field, bitch!

228
00:12:22,112 --> 00:12:24,405
<i> Now give me my
[BLEEP] enchiladas! </ i>

229
00:12:24,406 --> 00:12:28,346
Hey, Rick, you know, did they use Bill Murray for this?
Sounds a lot like Bill Murray.

230
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:31,886
No, Morty, it's Lorenzo Music. In
this reality, he's still alive.

231
00:12:31,887 --> 00:12:33,581
Oh, okay, was his
name Lorenzo Music?

232
00:12:33,582 --> 00:12:37,047
Yeah, I'm pretty sure. He also did that
voice of that one guy from Ghostbusters.

233
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:40,703
Which is really strange, because it's the same
character Bill Murray played in the movie.

234
00:12:40,704 --> 00:12:41,754
but then, when they
made the movie ...

235
00:12:41,755 --> 00:12:45,002
Bill Murray did the voice of
Gazorpazorp...or Garfield, I mean.

236
00:12:45,003 --> 00:12:47,682
Yeah, that's pretty cool, Rick. So all that 
happened in this reality too?

237
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:50,439
I don't know. Just making
conversation with you, Morty.

238
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,640
What do you think? I-I-I-I
know everything about everything?

239
00:12:54,157 --> 00:12:56,522
Did you really talk me out of
the abortion?

240
00:12:56,523 --> 00:12:59,181
Well, we--we blew a tire on the way
to the clinic.

241
00:12:59,547 --> 00:13:03,029
I think, in my head,
I was doing it all for the kids.

242
00:13:03,167 --> 00:13:07,174
And now the first kid is
going to... do something with turquoise.

243
00:13:07,175 --> 00:13:10,050
What is either code for crystal meth,
or a gateway to it.

244
00:13:10,051 --> 00:13:12,045
So we didn't do the kids
any favors.

245
00:13:12,046 --> 00:13:17,335
So, we should stay together for each 
other and ourselves, or...

246
00:13:17,336 --> 00:13:18,761
Or?

247
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:23,283
<i> Man. Woman.
And now trunk men? </ i>

248
00:13:23,284 --> 00:13:25,722
We know science has created
men that have a trunk

249
00:13:25,723 --> 00:13:28,604
<i> that allows them to have
sex with both male and female partners. </ I>

250
00:13:28,605 --> 00:13:31,547
<i> But we DON'T like the idea
of these people getting married. </ i>

251
00:13:31,548 --> 00:13:36,213
<i> Put a line in the sand everybod-, people!
Vote no on proposition XW2. </ i>

252
00:13:36,214 --> 00:13:37,932
The act that says
that gay--uh--trunk

253
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,864
people can get married.
Who needs it?

254
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:40,995
<i> Not on my watch! </ i>

255
00:13:40,996 --> 00:13:43,762
<i> Paid for by Michael Dennys
and The Denny Singers. </ i>

256
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:50,115
<i> Hi, I'm a trunk person. And I want--I-I feel
love in my heart, too. Just like you. </ i>

257
00:13:50,116 --> 00:13:53,563
<i> I want to be able to express
that love, with both a man and a woman. </ i>

258
00:13:53,564 --> 00:13:55,129
<i> And I won't be able to... </ i>

259
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:57,611
<i> If Denny and The Denny Singers
get their way. </ i>

260
00:13:57,612 --> 00:14:00,211
<i> Hey, let the trunk people
have sex and get married, huh? </ I>

261
00:14:00,212 --> 00:14:02,219
<i> Paid for by...
Trunk People. </ I>

262
00:14:03,082 --> 00:14:05,100
<i> Oh, I love me
Strawberry Smiggles! </ i>

263
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:10,369
Ooh, I hope nobody ever gets my hands on me,
and tries to steal my Strawberry Smiggles.

264
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:13,852
<i> I'm going to eat every last one of them,
because--and then they'll be in my stomach, </ i>

265
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,266
and nobody will ever be able to eat them.
Except for me,

266
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:18,704
because they're going to be 
all inside my stomach.

267
00:14:19,347 --> 00:14:22,949
<i> I'm--my name is Mister...
Top Hat Jones, </ i>

268
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:25,299
<i> and God forbid anyone ever take 
my sniggy--little pig-dul--smiggles. </ i>

<i> I'm keeping 'em 
all for me. </ I>

270
00:14:29,714 --> 00:14:31,129
<i> Last bite. </ i>

271
00:14:31,927 --> 00:14:35,600
<i> Oh, now they are all resting comfortably in my
stomach. Ooh, am I feeling good. </ I>

272
00:14:35,601 --> 00:14:37,072
<i> No!
Get away from me! </ I>

273
00:14:37,073 --> 00:14:39,762
<i> Get away from me and
my Strawberry Smiggles! No! </ i>

274
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,163
<i> Jesus Christ!
Jesus Christ! </ I>

275
00:14:44,164 --> 00:14:46,210
<i> It hurts!
My entrails are out! </ I>

276
00:14:46,211 --> 00:14:48,036
<i> Why would you even
want to eat these? </ i>

277

<i> They're soaked with my stomach acid!
Oh, Jesus Christ! Lord and savior and spirit! </ i>

<i> Save me!
Take me to the light! </ i>

<i> Oh, my God, I see
Demons! I see demons are coming! </ i>

280
00:14:59,479 --> 00:15:04,260
Jeez, Rick. Oh my god! That's some pretty
hardcore stuff, you know, for a cereal commercial.

281
00:15:04,261 --> 00:15:07,337
Well, you know, Morty, I mean,
You want to sell boxes of cereal,

282
00:15:07,338 --> 00:15:10,470
you gotta, you gotta, pump the gas a little. 	
Pedal to the metal, Morty.

283
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:15,576
<i> In a world, where muscular mannies,
are coming, and they're coming strong, </ i>

289
00:15:38,778 --> 00:15:41,258
- What in the hell?
- Sex sells, Morty.

290
00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:45,507
Sex sells what? Was
that a movie, or like, does it clean stuff?

291
00:15:45,976 --> 00:15:47,891
Hey, Dad.
W-w-what's going on?

292
00:15:47,892 --> 00:15:50,726
Oh, your mother and I are
going to be spending some time apart, Morty.

293
00:15:50,727 --> 00:15:53,550
And your sister found out 
she was an unwanted pregnancy.

294
00:15:53,969 --> 00:15:54,422
W-w-w-what?

295
00:15:54,448 --> 00:15:56,261
Speaking of "w-w-what", Morty...

296
00:15:57,072 --> 00:16:01,274
W-w-what should we watch next?
What about this?

297
00:16:01,275 --> 00:16:03,296
<i> Baby Legs,
you're a good detective... </ i>

298
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:05,999

- Detective, I'm... </ i>

301
00:16:10,371 --> 00:16:12,751

me, because I feel </ i>

303

it's the criminal! </ i>

I'm, I-I just learned a real valuable lesson. </ I>

<i> I'm coming, Baby Legs!
I'm...Regular Legs! </ i>

313
00:16:45,086 --> 00:16:47,156
<i> - We got him!
- Hey, that was good team work. </ i>

314
00:16:47,157 --> 00:16:49,120
<i>Baby Legs, and Regular Legs,
I'm proud of you two for working together,

</ i>

317
00:16:55,394 --> 00:16:58,056
<i> - But I'm proud of you that you did it.
- Hey thanks, chief! </ i>

318
00:16:58,057 --> 00:16:59,566
<i> Now get the [BLEEP] out of here! </ i>

319
00:16:59,567 --> 00:17:01,667
Pretty cool,
huh, Morty? ...Oh.

320
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,056
Uh, I thought
it was cool.

321
00:17:03,057 --> 00:17:05,307
I don't give a 
[BLEEP] what you think, Jerry.

322
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,253
Hey, uh...
Y-Y-Y-You doin' okay?

323
00:17:13,754 --> 00:17:15,167
I-I-I kind of know how you
feel, Summer.

324
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:17,004
No, you don't.
You're the little brother.

325
00:17:17,005 --> 00:17:19,905
You're not the cause of your parents'
misery. You're just a symptom of it.

326
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:23,449
- Can I show you something?
- Morty, no offense,

327
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,317
but a drawing of me you made
when you were 8

328
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:27,132
isn't gonna make 
make me feel like less of an accident.

329
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:30,093
That, out there?
That's my grave.

330
00:17:30,738 --> 00:17:31,906
Wait, what?

331
00:17:31,907 --> 00:17:35,922
On one of our adventures, Rick
and I basically destroyed the whole world.

332
00:17:35,923 --> 00:17:41,185
So we bailed on that reality, and we came to this one.
Because in this one, the world wasn't destroyed.

333
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:43,011
And in this one,
we were dead

334
00:17:43,012 --> 00:17:46,923
So we came here, a-a-and we buried ourselves,
and we took their place.

335
00:17:46,924 --> 00:17:50,002
And every morning, Summer,
I eat breakfast,

336
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:52,944
20 yards away from my
own rotting corpse.

337
00:17:52,945 --> 00:17:55,122
So, you're
not my brother?

338
00:17:55,123 --> 00:17:57,677
I'm better than your brother.
I'm a version of your brother

339
00:17:57,678 --> 00:17:59,771
you can trust,
when he says, "Don't run."

340
00:17:59,772 --> 00:18:03,237
Nobody exists on  purpose,
nobody belongs anywhere...

341
00:18:03,238 --> 00:18:06,538
