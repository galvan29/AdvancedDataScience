do anything!

not doing anything!

Rick and Morty,
not sticking to one path.

525
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,880
Trying different things,

526
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,740
Making sure to keep out
of a rut.

527
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,290
Doing stuff.
Sometimes not doing stuff.

528
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,050
Not even pushing a little bit
towards the limit.

529
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,710
Doing it alone or together.
Making sure to keep our eyes

530
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,330
on the prize.
Sometimes just relaxing.

531
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,370

the fuck you want, Morty.

532
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,370
-That's the end.
-Wait, wait, what the fuck?

533
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,480
H-Hold on. What the fuck
did you just say?

534
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,890
Nothing.
I didn't say anything.

535
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:45,650
I was just playing along
with you guys.

537

Garage, isolate Summer's voice
and play back.

538

Oh, and then you guys
can get married,

539
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,280
and, like,
suck each other off

540
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,900
in a testosterone-addled
fucking third-grade-boy.

541
