1
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,440
Got some fresh cod, whiting, bass,
dabs, conger, dogfish, coalfish...

2
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,040
Just cod.

3
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,640
Fresh cod it is, then, Doc.

4
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,600
Let me see now.

5
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,280
Not the whole fish. A half fillet.
Right.

6
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,400
Of course.

7
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,960
Yes.
No shame in cooking for one.

8
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,080
At least you're still shaving.
That's a good sign.

9
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,400
Most men get to your age with
nobody - throw in the towel.

10
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,240
Hygiene's always the first to go.

11
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,680
Like they think, 'Nobody
cares about me, I

12
00:01:35,681 --> 00:01:38,080
might as well sit
around in my Y-fronts.'

13
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,340
Tragic it is, Doc.
You just hang on in there.

14
00:01:40,341 --> 00:01:42,560
What's for you won't go by you.

15
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,960
Anything else?

16
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,000
No.

17
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,240
Martin.

18
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,960
Martin.

19
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,320
Martin.

20
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,880
Hello, love.

21
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,120
Clive!

22
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,720
Oh... you're not due back
till the 11th.

23
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,680
Well, it is the 11th.

24
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,240
You're a sight for sore eyes.

25
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,040
Oh, Clive! No, no, no. Oh, no.

26
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,560
Erm... I'll just put these flowers
in water.

27
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,840
Just wait a second, Sal.

28
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,480
There's something I want to say.
There's something I need to say.

29
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,360
I have decided to retire.

30
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,480
And you're to do the same.

31
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,920
What?

32
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,320
No. I'm too young to retire.

33
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,760
And too beautiful to stay stuck
behind the counter every day.

34
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,240
I want us to live, Sal,

35
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,280
while we still can.

36
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,600
Well, I thought you'd be happy.

37
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,640
Well...

38
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,680
it's just a surprise.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I mean, everything is a surprise.

40
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,120
Yeah.

41
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,160
Well, you think on about it.

42
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,160
I've got an appointment with the
doctor now for this damned arthritis,

43
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,200
so I'd best hobble on over there.

44
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,720
You hurry up, then. He's a busy man.
Don't want to keep him waiting.

45
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,440
No. Don't want to make things worse.

46
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,480
We're worried about the photos.

47
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,000
Can't show anyone the honeymoon
snaps with...

48
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,040
With this.

49
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,760
Look up.

50
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,440
Easy. I'm a married man now, Doc.
Can't have the wife getting jealous.

51
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,560
Have you being kissing
more than usual?

52
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,600
Well, it is our honeymoon.

53
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,760
It's stubble rash.
Avoid excessive kissing.

54
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,840
Well, what if we um...

55
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,960
Can't.

56
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,880
You need to shave at
least twice a day to

57
00:04:04,881 --> 00:04:07,400
avoid exacerbating
your wife's reaction.

58
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,560
Well, for better or worse,
in sickness and health.

59
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,640
I shall shave for you, milady,
as often as is necessary.

60
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,680
(GIGGLES)

61
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,200
I had to send her home. She was
all shivering and shaking away.

62
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,840
Yes, but you should have checked
with me first.

63
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,880
It's this flu bug that's going around.
Surprised we're still standing.

64
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,040
But we don't have a dinner lady now.
What about tomorrow?

65
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,480
It's taken care of.

66
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,520
Really?

67
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,760
Yeah. I got someone to cover.
Who?

68
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Bert Large.

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,120
There wasn't anyone else?
You're sure?

70
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,080
I asked around, but no.
Bert was the only one.

71
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,840
Hm. These notes are a mess.

72
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,080
Yeah. Well, the rig medic,
he gets a little er...

73
00:04:52,081 --> 00:04:54,280
distracted at times.

74
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,120
As far as I can see, it was the jolt
from a fall that inflamed your hip,

75
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,760
and you felt the arthritis
for the first time.

76
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,880
One moment I'm on the tower,
the next I'm on the ground.

77
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,000
Take off your trousers over there.

78
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,720
Do you know who else had arthritis?
Lucille Ball.

79
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,520
Didn't stop her from pursuing
her dreams, though.

80
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,780
When I first met my Sally,
I thought she was

81
00:05:15,781 --> 00:05:18,000
a dead ringer for her.
A proper beauty.

82
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,560
Right. Keep your left leg straight
and bend your right knee.

83
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,960
Straighten the right
and bend the left knee.

84
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,880
Hm.

85
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,440
Your right calf is significantly
thicker than the left.

86
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,880
It's swollen.

87
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,920
Really? I hadn't noticed it myself.

88
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,560
Though it has been smarting
since I took a tumble.

89
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,240
Bloody hell, Doc.

90
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,160
Give us a warning
before you start the torture.

91
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,460
Shouldn't be that tender.

92
00:05:49,461 --> 00:05:51,720
In the infirmary, did you
take any exercise at all?

93
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,960
They just told me to lie there
and relax.

94
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,960
'Don't speak, Clive' they said.
'Don't exert yourself. Stay there.'

95
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,400
How many days? Pull your trousers up.

96
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,520
Ten.

97
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,040
Why? What do you think it is?

98
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,520
There's a possibility it's
a deep vein thrombosis,

99
00:06:08,521 --> 00:06:10,960
caused by prolonged
rest, not a fall.

100
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,240
You need to get to the hospital
immediately. If it is a clot,

101
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,400
it could travel to a lung,
causing a pulmonary embolism.

102
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,120
I'm guessing
that's not a good thing.

103
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,880
A clot could block an artery to
the lungs, killing you instantly.

104
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,440
Bloody hell.

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Not like you to abandon post.

106
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,080
No, I was just going back
downstairs.

107
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,200
How was... Doctor Ellingham?

108
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,080
Might be bad news.

109
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,160
I need to go to the hospital
for scans.

110
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,440
Do you ever get that feeling, Sal,
that...

111
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,200
one day you wake up and realise how
much of your life you've wasted?

112
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,840
How much you've let pass you by.

113
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,200
I do, yes.

114
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,720
Right.

115
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,800
I'll get the kettle on, then,
shall I?

116
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

117
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,160
Louisa.

118
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,720
Come in.

119
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,960
How are you?

120
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,560
Well, OK.

121
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,400
I don't want to keep doing this, but
I've got a bit of a problem again.

122
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,520
I need you to look after James
tomorrow.

123
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,820
Mum's still recovering from
her operation, and I can't

124
00:08:02,821 --> 00:08:05,680
take him into school with
this flu going around.

125
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,720
And there's nobody else?

126
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,700
School's short staffed,
everyone's got this bug, and

127
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:14,600
I thought his father was
preferable to a stranger.

128
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,560
I may be wrong about that, though.

129
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,240
No. It's fine. Just...
I have consultations.

130
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,520
You have Morwenna.

131
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,400
It's not in her job description.

132
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,480
It's just one day. I have to take
the rest of the week off.

133
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,520
No, tomorrow is fine.

134
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,100
Thank you. Don't worry.
You're away in a couple of weeks.

135
00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:33,480
It won't be a regular feature.

136
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,040
You are going to come and visit
James, aren't you? Yes.

137
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,200
I mean, properly. Every weekend.

138
00:08:48,201 --> 00:08:50,320
Cos I don't want him
being messed around.

139
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,920
Every weekend would be difficult.
But most. Definitely.

140
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,440
And we still have his christening
to arrange.

141
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,600
Right. We'll see you tomorrow, then.
Good night.

142
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,800
Good night, James.

143
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,840
Bye, then.

144
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,580
Babysitting is not
in my job description.

145
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,340
Yes, I know.

146
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,460
(SIGHS) If I do this,
can I get a raise?

147
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,700
No.

148
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,540
A longer lunch?
Oh, come on.

149
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,420
At least ask me with a smile.

150
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,220
Morwenna.

151
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,260
Fine. Hand it over.
Thank you.

152
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,140
Act in haste, repent at leisure.

153
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,220
A baby's not some fashion accessory
for you young ones.

154
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,340
That's for life, that is.

155
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:12,260
You think this is mine? Seriously?
Look at the face.

156
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,780
I'd never have a baby like that.

157
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,060
No offence, like.

158
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,220
I brought my scans.

159
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,020
Doc's waiting for you.

160
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,900
Oh, that's nice.

161
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,500
For Clive.

162
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,540
You'd better stay here, Sal.

163
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,520
This might be bad news,
and if it is, I'd rather

164
00:10:30,521 --> 00:10:33,460
you heard it from my mouth
and not some doctor's.

165
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,060
(BABY CRIES)

166
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,180
As you can see, I was right.
Deep vein thrombosis.

167
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,500
So...

168
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,260
I could drop dead any time.

169
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,300
Not if you begin treatment, no.

170
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,780
Your notes say that you can't take
Warfarin,

171
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,140
so a better course would be a
daily injection of Heparin.

172
00:10:59,141 --> 00:11:01,460
Lift up your shirt, please.

173
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:06,100
You need to inject yourself
as close as possible to your navel.

174
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,220
Inject myself?

175
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,260
Every day.

176
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,260
I can't. It'd be like stabbing
myself in the belly.

177
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,980
No, it wouldn't.
It would.

178
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,540
No, it wouldn't. This will stop
your blood from clotting.

179
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,740
(BABY CRIES)

180
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,740
Maybe...

181
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,780
Maybe Sal could do this.

182
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,260
She is a medical professional...
of sorts.

183
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,340
She could it every day.

184
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,660
What are you crying about?

185
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,620
All you do is laze around
all day, eating and

186
00:11:41,621 --> 00:11:44,540
burping, people waiting
on you hand and foot.

187
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,100
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh.

188
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:54,500
You're a natural, Mrs T. Surprised
you don't have one of your own.

189
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,060
Could if I wanted.

190
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,220
Yeah. Bit late, though, now,
isn't it?

191
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,900
Or not.

192
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,500
Sal.

193
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:13,060
The doc needs you to give me
a daily injection of Heparin...

194
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,180
whatever that is.

195
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,700
Heparin comes from the ancient
Greek word hepar, which means liver.

196
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,180
Why have you got my baby?

197
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:26,660
James Henry was crying and I don't think
Morwenna is qualified to look after him.

198
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,740
And a waiting room is hardly
a suitable place for a baby.

199
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:32,500
Lots of patients coughing,
spluttering germs.

200
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,060
Yes. I'm very aware of that.

201
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,500
And I would be more than happy to
look after him for you, Doc.

202
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,020
Allow you to get on with your work
in peace.

203
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,700
Right. Good. Yes.

204
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,340
Erm... I'll collect him at lunch.

205
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,060
Lunch?

206
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,420
Yes.

207
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,980
Right, Sal. Give it a go, then.

208
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,340
Mr Tishell, would you?

209
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,380
If you... Here you go, little one.

210
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,780
That's right. There's a good boy.

211
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,340
Thank you.

212
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,660
Inject as close as possible
to the navel.

213
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,660
Good technique.

214
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,900
Thank you, Doc.

215
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,140
If you could just take it.
Thank you.

216
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,900
Hello, my sweetheart.

217
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,460
Right. That's it, then, Sal.
Homeward bound.

218
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,940
Doc... you're a genius.

219
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,820
Yes. He is.

220
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,300
So I will see you later, then...

221
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,140
Doctor.

222
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,180
Yes.

223
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,860
Brown rice? Couscous?

224
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,900
Bert.

225
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,460
Whatever happened to liver
and bacon? Toad-in-the-hole?

226
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,800
Our menu is organised
in advance.

227
00:13:47,801 --> 00:13:50,100
You're here to cook the
food, not change the menu.

228
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:53,620
Mount Everest. 1966 World Cup.
Battle of Hastings.

229
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,580
You can bet those men weren't
running on rabbit food.

230
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:00,540
Actually, a vegetarian diet
provides more than enough nutrition.

231
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,580
Mum, what are you doing here?

232
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,340
What... are you all right?

233
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:08,100
Yeah, yeah. Just getting a bit
bored, lying at home, recuperating.

234
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,060
I thought I'd come and see
my little girl at work.

235
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,100
Yeah. I'm just a bit busy right now.

236
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,140
Too busy for your old mum?

237
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,860
I'm working
and I have to check on a class.

238
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,100
I can wait.

239
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,140
Vegetable fried rice?

240
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,940
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

241
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:25,980
Come in.

242
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,740
Doc.

243
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,780
I'm here about my eyes.

244
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,380
Yes, I can see that.

245
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,620
Think it might be a side effect
of that flu bug going round.

246
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,660
Do you have any flu-like symptoms?

247
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,260
Not really.

248
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,540
Then it's not that, then.
Any sensitivity to bright light?

249
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,940
Blurred vision? Ocular pain?

250
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,420
Yes, yes and...

251
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,060
not sure what the last one means.

252
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,540
But the pain bit sounds about right.

253
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,540
It looks like iritis to me.
I'll prescribe you some drops.

254
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,340
It's bloodshot in the other eye,
as well.

255
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,580
That's right.

256
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,140
So why are you wearing
a single eye patch?

257
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,700
Well, come on, Doc,

258
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:15,220
I'd look a bit stupid wearing
two eye patches, now, wouldn't I?

259
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,860
Be blind as a bat.

260
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,900
Mm... Needs more salt.

261
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,340
Ooh. Put some basil in.

262
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,580
You're meant to be recuperating.

263
00:15:29,581 --> 00:15:31,780
Maybe you should give your
mouth a rest and all.

264
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,940
Louisa, tell this man to add basil.
He won't listen to me.

265
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,540
The children will be here soon.
Is it ready?

266
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,180
I need two vital ingredients.
Peace and quiet.

267
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,140
I heard you were putting a shift
in here.

268
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,380
Hello, Al.

269
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,820
Need a hand?

270
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,700
Hello, boy. It's under control.

271
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,300
Sure you can cook all this?

272
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,340
That's just what he was saying.

273
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:54,020
Oh, thank you, Al.
Mum, stop buzzing around them.

274
00:15:54,021 --> 00:15:56,660
It's not your job.
Leave them to it. Come on.

275
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,420
Couscous?

276
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,580
Not exactly sticking to the menu,
son.

277
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,620
Improvisation is the key.

278
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,540
It's funny seeing you at work.

279
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,980
Laying down the law.

280
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,820
It's like you're a real teacher
or something.

281
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,220
I am a real teacher.

282
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,260
Well, you know what I mean.

283
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,980
Like a proper teacher.

284
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,060
Mum...

285
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,740
I know. I know.
Look, what I'm trying to say is...

286
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,300
You know...

287
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,380
I'm proud of you.

288
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,660
And?

289
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,820
That's it.

290
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,860
No. There's always something else.

291
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,460
This place has made you paranoid.

292
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,820
I'm leaving Portwenn.

293
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,780
And there we have it.

294
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,860
Just for a little while.
I got a really good deal online.

295
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,900
So when are you off?

296
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,020
Later on today.

297
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:01,820
What? I can't face winter here.
It goes right through your bones.

298
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,860
Are you planning on coming back?

299
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,700
Yes. Fly south for the winter,
back for the summer.

300
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,100
It's just that...
with Martin leaving here

301
00:17:11,101 --> 00:17:13,780
as well, I wanted
to check it was OK.

302
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,700
I didn't want you feeling
like everyone's deserting you.

303
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,500
I don't.

304
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,940
At least, I didn't,
until you mentioned it.

305
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,940
It's fine.

306
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,300
It's gone beyond stubble rash.

307
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:37,940
Yeah. And I shaved, like you told
me. More. Three, four times.

308
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,620
Do you have any allergies?

309
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,140
Nuts. But I've been careful
not to eat any.

310
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,020
And duck feathers, but -
We brought our own pillows.

311
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,860
Any other changes?
Washing powder? Cosmetics?

312
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,140
No, it's like Michael always says -
I'm a creature of habit.

313
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,180
She really is.
I am, you know.

314
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,540
We were so looking forward to
taking photos, showing our friends.

315
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,620
Are you doing anything differently?

316
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,780
Well...

317
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,820
we did try some new er...

318
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,020
Positions.
..in the bedroom.

319
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,740
If that's what you mean.

320
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,700
No, it isn't.

321
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,860
Are you using any different products?

322
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,420
Right. No. No, don't think so.

323
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,700
The free ones.

324
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,460
We've been using the little
bottles you get in the

325
00:18:21,461 --> 00:18:24,180
place we're in.
One of the perks of being away.

326
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,740
A lot of bathroom
products contain nuts.

327
00:18:26,741 --> 00:18:29,260
Your wife has a nut allergy.
You should check that.

328
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,180
Oh, my God. The shaving cream.

329
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,700
I'm so sorry.

330
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,300
That's OK.

331
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:38,780
You can get some anti-histamine tablets
from the chemist. If symptoms persist...

332
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,020
We shan't be bothering you again.
We're going home today.

333
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,860
Yeah. Honeymoon over.
Back to the grindstone.

334
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:48,420
You're lucky, you know,
living in a place like this.

335
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,940
You're so, so lucky.

336
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:59,100
♪ Down will come baby
and cradle and all ♪

337
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,740
Found it.

338
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,500
Found what? Oh, dear.

339
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,540
The perfect one.

340
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,980
We don't need a car.

341
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,660
Not a car, a mobile home.

342
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,700
Why? Are you going somewhere?

343
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,740
Not me, Sal. Us.

344
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,740
This is our big chance
- out into the big,

345
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:21,740
wide world, spend some
proper time together.

346
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,940
Visit places we've dreamt of.

347
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,980
Southend-on-Sea.

348
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,100
Doncaster.

349
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,340
Peterborough.

350
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,660
I... I don't want to.

351
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,700
Why wouldn't you?

352
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:41,700
Look, I'll go scrub up and change, we'll
go out for lunch, have a nice chat.

353
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,740
I won't let this go, Sal.

354
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,820
Sometimes in this life,

355
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,020
if you want something,
you've got to take it.

356
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,700
Hello.

357
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,940
The doctor sent us to see you.

358
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:08,140
The doctor sent you to see me?

359
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,500
Oh, you're staying at the Castle?

360
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:18,180
Yeah, yeah.
Had such a wonderful time.

361
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,580
You ever been?

362
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,100
No. Never.

363
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,780
We were just telling the doctor
how lovely it is.

364
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,440
Genuinely jealous of the couple
that get to stay there next.

365
00:20:27,441 --> 00:20:30,060
Such a shame the
honeymoon is over.

366
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,220
It doesn't have to be.

367
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,620
If you wish upon a star...

368
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,660
if you hope with all your heart...

369
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,500
if you believe in love,
the honeymoon can last forever.

Poetry at the pharmacy.

371
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,060
I love this town.

372
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,100
And what a lovely baby.

373
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,820
It's his. The doctor's.

374
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,900
He wanted me to leave him with me,
cos we're very close.

375
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,580
How much do we owe you?

376
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,780
No charge.

377
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,900
No charge at all.

378
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,980
Really?

379
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,340
Um... thank you.
That's... that's so kind of you.

380
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,740
No. Thank you.

381
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,740
What do you want?

382
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,820
Doc said I've got to have this.

383
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,140
We are closed for lunch.

384
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,660
No, you're not.

385
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,700
Oh, well, come on, then.

386
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,740
Got to make it quick.

387
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,220
Take it away.

388

(HORN HOOTS)

389
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,420
Are you hurt?

390
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,140
No.

391
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,180
I can't see a thing, Doc.

392
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:31,260
It's those eye drops you made me
get. They're a nightmare.

393
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,140
Let me see them.

394
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,380
No! This is Pilocarpine.
You were meant to take Atropine.

395
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:44,300
I just handed over the prescription.

396
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,800
But they're opposites.
Atropine makes the

397
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:49,260
pupils wider, Pilocarpine
makes it smaller.

398
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,020
He's blinded himself.

399
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,620
I didn't hurt anyone, did I?

400
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,780
I'm going to the chemist.
Come with me.

401
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,100
Doc...

00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,700
What a lovely couple.

405
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,940
What's wrong?

406
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,340
It's closed.

407
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,540
It's vital I get my eyesight back
ASAP.

408
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:25,740
She has my child. I told her I'd be
back at lunch to get him.

409
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:30,140
I'd suggest she might have taken him for
a walk, but the buggy's still in here.

410
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:33,420
Very irresponsible of her,
Leaving a baby alone like that.

411
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:36,980
Says the policeman who just drove
his car over the harbour wall.

412
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,700
Mrs Tishell!

413
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:41,140
Step back, Doc. This one's on me.

414
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,300
Ow.

415
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,340
Out of the way.

416
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,820
Mrs Tishell!

417
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,860
What's the bloody noise for?

418
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,100
Where's your wife?

419
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,740
Look at that door!
Who's going to pay for that?

420
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,220
Is your wife upstairs?

421
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,620
I was in the bath.

422
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,660
Out of the way.

423
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,260
Mrs Tishell?

424
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,380
Found these upstairs.
Paroxetine and Modafinil.

425
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,260
That's worrying.
Yes. It is.

426
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,740
Very.

427
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,220
Paroxetine is used to treat
social anxiety.

428
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:49,020
Modafinil has sometimes been marketed as
an intelligence drug. Taken together...

429
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,380
So basically...

430
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:54,460
there's a drugged-up lunatic
on the run with your baby.

431
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,460
When did you last see her?

432
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,500
About 15, 20 minutes ago.

433
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,260
Did she have my baby with her?

434
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,660
Yeah, she did.

435
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,700
Martin, she left a note.

436
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:09,860
Dear Martin, I got your message.
I will meet you at the Castle.

437
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,900
I think you'd better tell me
what's been going on, Doc.

438
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,460
What do you mean?

439
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,980
My Sal, she's an attractive woman.

440
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,220
Alone here, while I'm away
on the rigs.

441
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,580
Don't be ridiculous.

442
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,300
Did you send her a message?
No.

443
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,900
What castle?
I don't know.

444
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,940
Maybe she means the Castle.

445
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,140
What?

446
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:34,100
The Castle Hotel. Most folk call it
the Castle.

447
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,060
Where is it?

448
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,500
I know the way.

449
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:40,340
You can't go charging off
without telling Louisa.

450
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,380
Yes, I know that.

It's chaos here. They haven't been fed.
They've been waiting for half an hour.

00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,860
Everyone, I've told you. Be quiet.

454
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,340
Please just tell me
if the food's ready.

455
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:09,540
Any minute now.
I told you. Nothing to worry about.

456
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,500
Over here. Let's dish it up.

457
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,660
A bit overdone.

00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,180
Just a tiny problem.

Bert. We could buy some oven chips,
shove 'em in, ten minutes.

461
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:28,580
No. There are strict guidelines
concerning the children's diet.

462
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,500
Louisa.

463
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,540
Can I speak to you?

464
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,420
Excuse me.

465
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,380
Is something wrong?

466
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:43,420
I wondered if Mrs Tishell had been
in contact with you.

467
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,300
No. Why?

468
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,940
She was looking after James
for a little while.

469
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,380
And she seems to have disappeared.

470
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,420
What?
It's nothing to worry about.

471
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,420
You gave our baby to Mrs Tishell?

472
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,740
I think we both agree
that Mrs Tishell is

473
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:59,020
a more responsible
person than Morwenna.

474
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,660
So where's our baby?

475
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,820
I have reason to believe she took
him to the Castle Hotel.

476
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,540
Why?

477
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,300
She wants me to meet her there.

478
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,100
What? But why?

479
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:12,200
She's been self-prescribing a
combination of drugs and...

480
00:28:12,201 --> 00:28:15,260
seems to have formed
a fixation on me.

481
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,300
Right. I'm coming with you.

482
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,780
You're in charge.

483
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,780

And how do you know that?

Because of the one thing
a policeman can always

508
00:29:44,481 --> 00:29:46,900
rely on - his instinct.
Isn't that right?

509
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:50,140
Much as I'd love to agree with you
and say the child is safe,

she's capable of,

especially if put in a situation
where she feels threatened.

She has newspaper cuttings about me
pinned up inside her wardrobe.

be worried, Louisa.

00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,380
I'd need to get permission.

528
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:53,820
You need to tell us if anyone has
checked in with a baby. Yes or no?

529
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:57,020
The duty manager's busy.
We've got a wedding.

530
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:01,220
I am two seconds away from charging
you with wasting police time.

531
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,620
That's not helping.

532
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,900
I'm doing my best.

533
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,860
This is ridiculous. Both of you,
stop bullying him.

534
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:10,580
And you, stop snivelling.
A child may be in danger.

535
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,320
So grow a backbone, check
that damn machine, and

536
00:31:13,321 --> 00:31:16,020
tell us whether a woman has
checked in with a baby.

537
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,620
Right.

538
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:26,580
Yeah. About an hour ago.
A Ms Smith checked in.

539
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,580
Requested a baby cot.

540
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,540
Room 117.

541
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:33,340
Ms Smith. An alias if ever
I've heard one.

542
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,180
Does she fit our description?

543
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,260
I didn't check her in.

544
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,460
Give me the keys.

545
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,020
We're really not meant to.

546
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,780
Please.

Mrs Tishell?

549
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:12,380
Empty. Almost too empty.

550
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,940
She must be somewhere else.

551
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:17,620
Where, though? There's two
restaurants and cellars and grounds.

552
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:21,300
She's obviously not thinking
rationally. She could be anywhere.

553
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:24,780
Ms Smith was marked as joining
the Edmondson party downstairs.

554
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:27,220
Why didn't you say so before,
you imbecile?

555
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,300
Please wait, sir!

556
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,900
Mrs Tishell!

557
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:36,380
Police! Nobody move.
Where are you, Mrs Tishell?

558
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:40,140
Or should I say, Ms Smith?

559
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,980
Uh... hello?

00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,820
It's her!

562
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:54,300
Be calm, Martin. You don't want to
upset her.

563
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,780
I know.
Don't bark at her.

564
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:58,260
I'm not going to.
I've had training for this.

565
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,540
Where are you?

566
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,580
Don't worry. I'm waiting for you.

567
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:07,300
So clever to send that lovely
couple to tell me where to go.

568
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:11,940
I'm here. I'm in the hotel. Come down
to reception with the baby - now.

569
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,980
Hotel?

570
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,140
Oh...

571
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:18,820
Oh, Dr Ellingham, you're
playing games with

572
00:33:18,821 --> 00:33:21,460
me, aren't you? Ooh!
I'll see you soon.

573
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,500
Just tell me where you are.

574
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:26,300
What did she say? Did she mention
the baby?

575
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:30,300
She's not here. She said something about
a couple to show her where to go.

576
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,980
A couple of what?

577
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,220
A couple. People.

578
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:37,060
What people? I don't know.
Stop asking inane questions.

579
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,700
Doc...
Be quiet.

580
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:43,580
I passed a couple before,
coming out of the chemist.

581
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:47,140
Could only have been 15 minutes
or so before Mrs T disappeared.

582
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:50,220
Woman had a red, blotchy face.
Might be nothing, but...

583
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,940
Stubble rash.

584

Shush.

up at Carmore Point.

Oh.

00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:46,180
Doctor wouldn't be happy if I lost
our child now, would he, now?

602
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,980
No, he wouldn't.

603
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,020
No, he wouldn't.

604
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,900
You good little boy.

605
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,240
I think it best that you stay here.

606
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,480
I'm police. I have to be there.
You wait.

607
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,240
I actually have experience of this
kind of thing.

608
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,080
Village Fete, 2003, ring any bells?

00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,560
Of course it doesn't.

Turned nasty, till I stepped in.

611
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,760
How wonderfully reassuring.

612
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,460
I may have to get a little
harsh with Mrs Tishell.

613
00:35:41,461 --> 00:35:43,760
Hostage situations
are like that.

614
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,800
I'd rather you just kept quiet.

615
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,440
Or maybe softly-softly. 'Trust me,
Mrs T. I'm on your side.'

616
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,800
You do realise we're dealing
with a highly volatile person?

617
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:57,480
There's no knowing how she'll react.
You're not playing in a Hollywood film.

618
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,520
You're not Clint Eastwood.

619
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,160

Any minute now. Knock, knock, knock.
And my Romeo will have come.

and Juliet is the sun.

624
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,980
You can't just barge in.
If she gets a hint that

625
00:36:35,981 --> 00:36:38,640
something's amiss, you
could endanger the child.

626
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,360
Do you expect me to knock
and politely wait?

627
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,800
She's right. You have to stay calm,
for James Henry's sake.

Yes, I'm well aware of that.

going to take us so much farther (!)

637
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,760
Oh, you came.

638
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,680
All this way, alone.

639
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,240
I knew you would.

640
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,240
Just bring the baby down here now.

641
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Oh, you almost sound angry.

642
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,160
Martin, let her think you're happy
to be here.

643
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:25,480
No. Delusions are only reinforced by
pretending you think they're real.

644
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,520
I don't care about her.
I just want my baby back.

645
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,920
Why don't you just come down here
and we can talk about it.

646
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,920
I don't want to get hurt.
My poor heart couldn't take it.

647
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,320
Nobody's going to hurt you.
Bring the baby downstairs.

648
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,280
The first day you came to town,
everything changed.

649
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,400
Yes, I realise that, Mrs Tishell.

650
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,000
I mean, I... I've been waiting
for you so long,

651
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:55,120
while you've been running around
with that school teacher trollop.

652
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,680
One moment you're together,
then you're not,

653
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:01,240
then you're getting married,
then you're not, then she's gone,

654
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,520
then you're going, but you don't,
and then you have a baby

655
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,520
and you're living together
and then you're not, and

656
00:38:07,521 --> 00:38:10,480
then you're going away and
I can't stand it anymore!

657
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,840
Mrs Tishell, you have been taking a
combination of Paroxetine and Modafinil,

658
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,720
and as a result, you're having
a psychotic episode.

659
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,160
No! It's allowed me to feel free!

660
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,280
To be smarter.

661
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,080
I've never seen anything so clearly.

662
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,800
I see everything.

663
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,640
My hopes, my dreams, our future.

664
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,800
You called the police!

665
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,400
No, I didn't.

666
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,760
Yes. Well, then, why is PC Penhale
standing there, then?

667
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,920
No, no, no, no.

668
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,040
No, this won't do.

669
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,080
No, this is wrong.

670
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,480
You lied to me.

671
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,520
No, I didn't.

672
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:06,200
I wanted him here because I...

673
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,520
What?

674
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,520
Because...

675
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,200
(Share our wonderful love.)

676
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,560
No. Let her know you're
concerned about her

677
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,880
and she needs help.
Let her know you care.

678
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,000
And you love her.

679
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,440
That won't help.

680
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,680
I wanted him PC Penhale here
because...

681
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,360
I wanted to share our wonderful love.

682
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,640
What, you mean...

683
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,320
you want everyone to know?

684
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,400
What - how you feel about me?

685
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,800
Yes. That.

686
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,240
Really, Doctor Ellingham?

687
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,480
Yes, really.

688
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,880
I always thought you saw me
as an intelligent person.

689
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,560
I do.

690
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,600
As an intellectual equal.

691
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,360
Absolutely.

692
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,320
Then why are you telling me
all these lies?

693
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,160
I'm not.

694
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:04,400
If you wanted to tell me how you
felt, why have you waited so long?

695
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,280
You've had so many chances.

696
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,520
So, so many chances.

697
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,080
Tell her to come down
so that you can talk about it.

698
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,920
No, no! you need to convince her
that you really do care.

699
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,000
Why, Doctor?

700
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,120
You know nothing about psychology.

701
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,600
Tell her you know you're a difficult
person.

702
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,960
What?
Tell her you're a difficult person.

703
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,800
I'm a difficult person.

704
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,520
And I waited so long because I'm...

705
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,080
an idiot.

706
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:45,760
I think I've how I felt since
the first time I met you...

707
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,920
From the first time I saw you.

708
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:53,080
And I know I'm hard to talk to
sometimes.

709
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,320
I'm aware of that.

710
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,160
And I do hate Portwenn.

711
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,480
I hate the people.

712
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:05,600
Their pinched faces
and their ridiculous accents,

713
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,300
and their unerring
knack of catching any

714
00:41:08,301 --> 00:41:10,960
virus that comes within
a five-mile radius,

715
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,640
then spread contagion like
a bush fire.

716
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,960
But it's where I want to be.

717
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,320
Because you're here.

718
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,360
Because of you.

719
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,120
Because if I'm with you...

720
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,520
nothing else matters.

721
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,800
What I'm trying to say is...

722
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,960
I love you.

723
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,680
Oh, Martin!

724
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,520
I love you too.

725
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,560
Why don't you come down here
and be with me?

726
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,200
Give me one last chance.

727
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,760
Please.

728
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:58,040
That poor, deranged woman will probably
throw herself out of the window now,

729
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,080
as an expression of her love.

730
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,160
I think she's coming down.

731
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,640
Oh...

732
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,960
Oh. Oh.

733
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,120
Why is she here?

734
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,160
Because you took my baby.

735
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,680
No, no, no, no, no.
You're meant to be with me.

736
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,720
This isn't how the fairytale ends.

737
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,760
It's the handsome prince and the...

738
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,400
The erm...

739
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:45,000
The married pharmacist
who needs to come with

740
00:42:45,001 --> 00:42:47,560
me because she's suffered
a psychotic episode

741
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,640
brought on by excessive
dosage of prescription drugs.

742
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,480
Doctor?

743
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:57,040
You must go with this Dr Ellingham, who
will give you anti-psychotic medication

744
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,000
to counteract the effects
of the drugs you've taken.

745
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,720
I don't think you understand
what love is.

746
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,120
What?
Don't worry.

747
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,840
Just a bit of a tumble.

748
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I'll be OK, probably.

749
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,560
Mrs Tishell, I'm arresting you
for kidnapping a minor.

750
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,480
No, you're not. She's ill.
She needs help.

751
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,760
Don't know why I bother
getting these things out.

752
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,680
Help me get her to the car.

753
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,840
I called her husband.
He's on his way.

754
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:29,880
Clive?

755
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,880
Don't worry. You'll see him soon.

756
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,920
No. Dr Ellingham!

757
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,720
I'll wait for you.

758
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,560
Does he seem all right?

759
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,600
I think he's fine.

760
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,880
He seems fine.

761
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:56,520
Did you mean what you said
about staying here? Or was that...

762
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,920
No, I meant it. All of it.

763
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,080
I've waited so long to hear you say
nice things.

764
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,320
And I'd given up.

765
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,400
I'd completely given up.

766
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:12,600
And then to hear you say them
today... to someone else...

767
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,000
It doesn't matter.

768
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,120
No, it does to me.

769
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,160
No. I mean, everything.

770
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,200
What school James goes to. London.

771
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,240
None of it matters to me.

772
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:26,000
I'm not going to be like my father.
And he's not going to be like me.

773
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,960
And I do love you.

774
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,640
Say it again.

775
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,920
I've already said it twice.

776
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,080
I know, but... say it again, anyway.

777
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,080
I will always -
Sorry, guys.

778
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:59,760
I must have dropped my police radio
when I jumped from the balcony,

779
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:03,400
and well... they make you pay
for them if you lose them.

780
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,960
So er... you carry on.

781
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,840
Hm.

782
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,440
