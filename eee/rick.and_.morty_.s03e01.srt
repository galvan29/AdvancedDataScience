1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,780
Anyway, that's how I
escaped from space prison!

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,050
Oh, scary place.

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,620
Wow, Rick! That's... That's
one... one heck of a story.

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,760
I sure do wish I could have been
there to see it happen. Oh, come on.

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,730
Who wants to watch a mad scientist
use handmade sci-fi tools

6
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,700
to take out highly trained
alien guards

7
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,730
when we can sit here
and be a family at Shoney's?

8
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,630
Dad, it's great to have you
back, no matter where we are,

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,340
but wouldn't you like
to go home?

10
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,540
Emotionally speaking, honey,
Shoney's is my home.

11
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,910
Yeah, but you just
got out of prison.

12
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,410
I mean, how much of a step up
from that is...

13
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,180
Jerry, get out of the booth,
take all your clothes off,

14
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,380
and fold yourself 12 times.

15
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,850
You got it.

16
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,550
Six folds, huh?

17
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:39,420
W-W-What, have you guys got me
in a Series 9000?

18
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,490
You cheap insect [bleep] didn't think
I was worth your best equipment?

19
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,360
Man, I told the money bugs.

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,430
I said, "You know
who this guy is, right?

21
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,460
You want me to get intel
out of the smartest mammal

22
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:52,300
in the galaxy, you better
give me a decent brainalyzer."

23
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,000
Well, you might as well
order some pancakes,

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,240
because I don't see the need
to leave this part of my brain.

25
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,670
Oh, I think you do.

26
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,810
Eventually, you're either gonna
relax your cerebellum...

27
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,880
Shoney's... or the Series 9000
is going to turn it into mush.

28
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,210
Relaxed enough?

29
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,410
I admire you, Rick.

30
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,920
When I...

31
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:11,320
Rick, here's...

32
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,220
What's going on?

33
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,390
It's hard to tell. He may have
manifested some sort of butt.

34
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:18,630
He can do that?

35
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,760
He is the smartest man
in the universe.

36
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,440
I tell ya, the Galactic
Federation taking over Earth...

37
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,440
Best thing that's ever happened
to this family.

38
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,350
I just got my sixth promotion
this week,

39
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,580
and I still don't know
what I do.

40
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,320
Who cares how high
they promote you?

41
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,850
Everyone just gets paid
in pills.

42
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,850
Well, when you're not sure
what you do for a living,

43
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,290
<i>you</i> can make your own rules.

44
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,490
Summer, show your father
some respect.

45
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,890
He's pulling down
a six-chewable figure income.

46
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,930
I'll get that in a moment.
How are everyone's pills?

47
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,930
Oh, Morty, you've hardly
touched your pills.

48
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,970
I kind of had big pills
for lunch, and I

49
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:59,130
wasn't gonna eat any more pills.

50
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,570
Thank you, Conroy.

51
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:02,840
You spoil us, Conroy.

52
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,640
Grandpa Rick wouldn't put up
with this!

53
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,310
Stop saying his name!
He abandoned us.

54
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,840
Willem Dafoe!

55
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,880
Th-That's the guy I couldn't
think of this morning.

56
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,380
Don't make my mistake, Summer.

57
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,150
Don't deify the people
that leave you.

58
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:17,450
You'll end up a horse surgeon
in a world controlled by aliens

59
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,350
whose medicine keeps horses

60
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,960
healthy forever.

61
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,890
Horses live longer
than tortoises now.

62
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,490
Is that what you want
for yourself?

63
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:27,600
Maybe I just want you to care
if I run away yelling!

64
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,130
Who saved room for pill brûlée?

65
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,700
Ooh!

66
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,170
I can see why you chose
this family-friendly restaurant

67
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:34,640
to represent your cerebellum.

68
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,870
So safe, so comfortable,
so Shoney's.

69
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:41,140
But admit it, Rick... you're
going crazy cooped up in here.

70
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,480
Let's go visit some memories.

71
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,680
Oh, any particular ones?

72
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,410
You want to see my first boner,

73
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,550
or should we go straight
to the moment

74
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,320
I discovered
interdimensional travel?

75
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,890
Ooh, your little flappy doodles
are twitching.

76
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,990
Does that mean you're aroused,
or did you just get a signal

77
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,520
that one of your buddies
found a grape?

78
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,820
It's arousal.

79
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,730
Yes, I'd like very much
to visit the memory

80
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:58,990
of you inventing
your portal gun.

81
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,860
Yeah, well, tough titties.

82
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,370
There's no tougher titty
than a psychotic break, Rick.

83
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,600
Well, that depends on who breaks
first... me or the titty.

84
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,870
Someone special you remember?

85
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,810
Is that your memory of her
out there...

86
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,480
Between where you were on 9/11

87
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,210
and your favorite
sports blooper?

88
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,950
If we stay here, you'll die,
along with all your memories.

89
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,920
If you take me
where I want to go...

90
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,720
she'll be there, too, won't she?

91
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,820
The day I invented the portal
gun is the day I lost her.

92
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,390
Oh, that sounds cool.

93
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,360
I can get what I want
and you can say goodbye.

94
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,130
Fine, but I'm driving.

95
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,100
As an excuse
to strip away our freedom.

96
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,000
Huh? What are you...
What are you doing?

97
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,740
Grandpa Rick must have
some secret lab, right?

98
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,540
With, like, laser guns and
jets packs and a space tank!

99
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,140
And we can go
break him out of prison!

100
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,510
Look at these dead flies!

101
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,880
Maybe if we arrange them
in a certain order,

102
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,720
it plays a hologram
or it opens a secret door.

103
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,280
Summer, you're freaking me out.

104
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,620
I know things have changed
a lot, and I know you miss Rick,

105
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,620
but getting him back
wouldn't make things better.

106
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,190
And, you know,
we're not doing so bad.

107
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,690
We're miserable, Morty!

108
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,890
There's a mandatory curfew,
their weird calendar made me 47,

109
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,800
and they weaponized
the Eiffel Tower!

110
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,400
Hey, I like being 35.
I-I can rent a car now.

111
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,730
Because you suck.

112
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,070
You've been keeping
your lip zipped about it

113
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,970
since Grandpa got arrested,
but the fact is,

114
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,040
you're freaking stoked
to bail on him.

115
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,440
He bails on everybody!

116
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,110
He bailed on Mom
when she was a kid!

117
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,840
He... He bailed
on tiny planet!

118
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,480
And in case I never made this
clear to you, Summer,

119
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,880
he bailed on you.

120
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,550
He left you to rot
in a world that he ruined

121
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,820
because he doesn't care!

122
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,520
Because nobody's special to him,
Summer,

123
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,050
not even himself.

124
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,120
So, if you really want your
grandpa back, grab a shovel.

125
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,960
The one that won't let you down
is buried in your backyard!

126
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,930
You're right!

127
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,690
What?!
No, I'm not right.

128
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,800
I-I was using
ghoulish overkill!

129
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,260
Ghoulish overkill, Summer!

130
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,140
Oh, God!
Oh, God!

131
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,140
Whoa, whoa!

132
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,080
Where are we going?

133
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,940
To the day it all began...
and ended.

134
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:58,180
The moment
that changed everything.

135
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,620
<i>Welcome to McDonald's.
Can I take your order?</i>

136
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,350
Yeah, I'd like to get
a 10-piece McNugget

137
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,020
and a bunch
of the Szechuan sauce.

138
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,820
Like, as much as you're allowed
to give me.

139
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,690
In 1998, they had this promotion
for the Disney film "Mulan,"

140
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,030
where they...
Where they...

141
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,890
They created a new sauce
for the McNuggets

142
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,260
called Szechuan sauce,
and it's delicious!

143
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,330
And then they got rid of it,
and now it's gone.

144
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,200
This is the only place we're gonna
be able to try it, is in my memory.

145
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,340
Rick, you're doing this bit
while your brain is melting.

146
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,970
Okay. All right,
all right.

147
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:28,080
Is that...
Me.

148
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,010
I used to wear blue pants.

149
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,020
When'd you make the leap
to interdimensional travel?

150
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,750
I didn't.
<i>I</i> did.

151
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,360
Well, well, well.

152
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,960
If it isn't us.

153
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,790
You know the worst part
about inventing teleportation?

154
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,390
Suddenly, you're able to travel
the whole galaxy,

155
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,730
and the first thing
you learn is,

156
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,430
you're the last guy
to invent teleportation.

157
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:53,030
Fortunately, you're about to invent
something much more powerful.

158
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,640
What?

159
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,180
Summer, nobody has to know
about that.

160
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,550
We could put it right back
and pretend we never saw it,

161
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,020
like we did
with Dad's mannequin leg.

162
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,390
Fine, stay here.
I'll rescue Grandpa myself.

163
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,420
And how are you gonna do that?
I don't know yet.

164
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,620
I'll make it up as I go.

165
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,860
That's what Grandpa Rick does.

166
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,120
That's what heroes do.

167
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:17,990
Y-You want to see
what a hero Rick is?

168
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,790
I-I'll bring you somewhere,
Summer.

169
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,430
Um...
My goodness, children.

170
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,170
Relinquish
the illegal technology

171
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:27,370
to the nearest
Federation representative.

172
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,840
And then
we'll all play Balderdash.

173
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,290
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, oh! My goo...

174
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,560
Oh, my God.

175
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,830
I have that exact same top.

176
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,270
What is this place?

177
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,100
And what's with
"Hunger Games" Summer?

178
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:03,070
That's my sister.
This used to be my home.

179
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,570
Imagine doing anything you want,

180
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,870
then hopping to a timeline
where you never did it.

181
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,510
Imagine going anywhere, anytime,

182
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,080
with nobody able to stop you.

183
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,680
Sounds lonely.

184
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,450
Lonely? Dude,
you have yourself...

185
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,680
Your infinite selves.

186
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,220
It's a nonstop party
where all the guests

187
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,890
are the only person we like.

188
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,520
You think it's cool
being the smartest man on Earth,

189
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,120
but once we give you
this technology,

190
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,930
you become the smartest thing
in every conceivable universe...

191
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,530
The Infinite Rick, a god.

192
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,900
Eh, pass.

193
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,630
Excuse me?
Bro, Ricks don't pass on this.

194
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,800
Who do you think you are?

195
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,940
A different kind of Rick,
I guess.

196
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,600
Well, we'll see how long
that lasts.

197
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,640
I heard
sci-fi noises.

198
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,210
Did you make a breakthrough?

199
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,210
Sort of.

200
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,910
I just took
a long look at myself,

201
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:47,550
and I don't think this
science thing is gonna pay off.

202
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,050
Well, why don't I get Beth
and we'll go out for ice cream?

203
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,150
That, Dianne,
is the last great idea

204
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,660
that will ever be had
in this garage.

205
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,460
Good roasted Cronenberg,
I assume.

206
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,970
Mom, you're looking...
feral.

207
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,370
I can't believe Rick did this.

208
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,970
These are the parts
of Rick's adventures

209
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:11,610
you don't get to see...
The parts he leaves behind.

210
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,440
All right,
it's been great, guys.

211
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,610
I really only wanted to stop by
here for a quick "I told ya so."

212
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,580
So, uh...
Looking for this?

213
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,780
What are you doing with that?!

214
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,950
It stinks of Rick.

215
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,190
No! Why?!
Why would you do that?!

216
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,920
W-W-What is the matter
with you people?!

217
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,420
You can never leave.
She cannot remain.

218
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,730
She stinks of Rick.

219
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,700
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

220
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,570
I'm Morty C-137.

221
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,070
We detected a compromised
portal gun. Where is your Rick?

222
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,340
He's in prison.
Summer.

223
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,010
He got captured
by the Federation

224
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,440
and we were going to rescue him.

225
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,840
Very troubling.
We can't risk Citadel secrets

226
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,310
falling into
the Federation's hands.

227
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:51,410
We'll dispatch S.E.A.L.
Team Ricks immediately

228
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,480
to break into the prison
holding C-137.

229
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,780
Boo-yah.
And assassinate him.

230
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,690
Boo-nah?

231
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:01,490
Come on, girls!
The ice cream's gonna melt.

232
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:15,870
Nooooooo!

233
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,710
Wow.
This sauce is [bleep] amazing.

234
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,170
You said it was promoting
a movie?

235
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,200
Carry the three, add a two.

236
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:29,070
I got it.
I [bleep] got it.

237
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,540
Whoa.
I-Is that it, the portal gun?

238
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,650
Yeah.
That's the three lines of math

239
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:37,020
that separates my life as a man
from my life as an unfeeling ghost.

240
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,450
Awesome-possum.

241
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,290
Mission Control,
you getting this?

242
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:44,060
Holy shit, yes!
Yes, we got it! Yeah!

243
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,030
Thanks, Rick. I'll try to remember
to shut off the brainalyzer.

244
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,430
Actually, I think
it shuts off automatically

245
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,830
once your brain is liquid.

246
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,030
Don't know, don't care.

247
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,930
Pull me out.

248
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,770
Hey, pull me out.
Can you hear me?

249
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,700
Nope, they cannot.
Why not?

250
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,540
Because the code you just uploaded
wasn't actually my portal-gun formula,

251
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,380
it was a virus giving me full
control over the brainalyzer.

252
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,140
What are you talking about?
This is a memory.

253
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:07,050
Y-You can't alter details
of a memory.

254
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,250
True, but you can alter
anything you want

255
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,680
about a totally fabricated
origin story.

256
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,390
It's a trap! Abort!
I'm still in his Shoney's!

257
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,350
Repeat... we never left
his Shoney's!

258
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,660
Mission accomplished, boys.
Pull me out.

259
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,890
Roger that.

260
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,090
Okay, have fun in what's left
of my brain.

261
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,460
I'm gonna transfer to yours.

262
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,460
Oh, there's not enough room
for all my genius,

263
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,500
so I'm leaving you with
my fear of wicker furniture,

264
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,000
my desire to play the trumpet,

265
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,500
my tentative plans
to purchase a hat,

266
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,170
and six years
of improv workshops.

267
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,540
Comedy comes in threes.

268
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,140
It's a trap! Abort!
We never left his...

269
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,410
No!

270
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,380
Another day, another dollar.

271
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,980
Am I great insect creature
or what?!

272
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,150
Congratulations, Agent.

273
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,790
You'll be highly commended
for this.

274
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,850
Always wait for permission
to feel accomplishment.

275
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:51,260
That's my motto. One thing
still perplexes me...

276
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,060
Why would Rick Sanchez
turn himself in?

277
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,530
Well, I'm just a dumb-ass bug,
but it's possible Rick knew

278
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,300
he'd be interrogated
at this facility,

279
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,060
where we not only keep
our most wanted,

280
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,530
but our most sensitive data.

281
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:02,330
Anyone here with level-nine
access could

282
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,070
I don't know,
collapse a government.

283
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,470
I'm just gonna go take a dump.

284
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,540
Is it cool if I use
the level-nine bathroom?

285
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,970
W-W-What's the level-nine
master access code again?

286
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,510
Oh, that's easy...
8-3...

287
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,550
Yeah!

288
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,210
S.E.A.L. Team Ricks
in the house!

289
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,780
Hi, Rick.

290
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,220
Bye, Rick.

291
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,760
D-99, y-you okay?

292
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,500
I'm bummed I didn't get to give
that insect dick a test-drive.

293
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,400
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
T-The Council of Ricks sent us.

294
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,600
We have your Morty and Summer.

295
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,100
They're prisoners
on the Citadel.

296
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,430
Great!

297
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,740
<i>Security breach in room 6755.</i>

298
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,170
Lovely. Not only
is my plan screwed up,

299
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:42,670
I also forgot how to improvise.

300
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,640
<i>All security people approach.</i>

301
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,780
<i>Security breach.</i>

302
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,620
A city of Grandpas?

303
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,350
Morty:
It's the Citadel of Ricks.

304
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,160
All the different Ricks
from all the different realities

305
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,820
got together to hide here
from the government.

306
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,590
But if every Rick
hates the government,

307
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,060
why would they hate Grandpa?

308
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,060
Because Ricks hate themselves
the most.

309
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:07,770
And our Rick
is the most... himself.

310
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,070
Not anymore, homey.

311
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,500
S.E.A.L. Team Ricks
turned his unibrow

312
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,940
into two brows...
With a bullet.

313
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:17,010
Your Rick's dead!
Your Rick's dead!

314
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,210
♪

315
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:22,580
Sir, Rick D-99 is returning
from the mission alone.

316
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,650
Apparently, S.E.A.L. Team Ricks
suffered heavy casualties.

317
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:26,920
Bring him in.

318
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,790
He says he'll only talk to
a Rick with higher clearance.

319
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,520
La-di-da.
Give me that.

320
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:35,060
D-99, this is the commander in
chief of the Citadel's militia.

321
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,160
Go...
Good enough.

322
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,670
He's a spy. Blow him up.
I'm gonna go take a shit.

323
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,940
Operating
an unregistered portal gun,

324
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,500
radicalizing a Summer,

325
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,170
conspiring with
a traitorous Rick.

326
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:48,370
How do you plead?

327
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,810
How is this a fair trial?

328
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,310
O-Our lawyer
is a Morty.

329
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,610
It's not fair, you have no
rights, and he's not a lawyer.

330
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,350
We just keep him here
because he's fun.

331
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,750
Look at him go.

332
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,880
Ha ha, yeah!

333
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,420
We'll be lenient
if you renounce your Rick.

334
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,850
What say you, Summer?

335
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,050
I say [bleep] you!

336
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,660
My grandpa was my hero.

337
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,490
You killed him
because you were jealous of him.

338
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,160
That's pretty obvious
from the haircuts.

339
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,460
So do what you want to me,
but let my brother go.

340
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,100
He already renounced Rick.

341
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,260
Morty?

342
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,700
What?

343
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,300
N-No, I don't want to see
your Pog collection.

344
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,670
I don't renounce Rick,
and I never have.

345
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:22,170
I was just trying
to protect my sister.

346
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,840
I wanted you to have
a normal life.

347
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,810
That's something you can't have
when Rick shows up.

348
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:28,610
Everything real turns fake.
Everything right is wrong.

349
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,380
All you know is that you know
nothing and he knows everything.

350
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,150
And, well... well,
he's not a villain, Summer,

351
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,890
but he shouldn't be your hero.

352
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:39,220
He's more like a demon
or a super [bleep]up god.

353
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,490
Let's not suck the ghost
of his [bleep] too hard.

354
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,030
He was a terrorist,
and now he's dead.

355
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,000
Oh, yeah? If you think
my Rick's dead, he's alive.

356
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,170
And if you think you're safe,
he's coming for you!

357
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,970
Hey, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing in here?

358
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,480
This area's for teleporting
the entire Citadel

359
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,110
to somewhere else
using only buttons and dials.

360
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,750
Yeah, well, it's a bad idea

361
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,720
to have it designed
that way then, isn't it?

362
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,660
What the

363
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,230
We just teleported into
a galactic federal prison.

364
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,730
I'm gonna go take a shit.

365
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,160
Lawyer Morty:
Order in the court!

366
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,960
Whoa! What the hell?!
Oh, my God!

367
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,500
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
No, no, no!

368
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:31,140
Whoa!

369
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,640
Whoa!

370
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:43,390
The Citadel's been teleported
to Federation space.

371
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:45,920
It's doomed.
This has to be C-137, you guys.

372
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,660
What are we gonna do?!
You know he's coming for us.

373
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,890
All right, calm down!
We have his Summer as a hostage.

374
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,030
Obviously, I get her.

375
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:53,560
You guys play Rick, Laser,
Scissors for the Morty.

376
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,630
W-W-What the hell
is that?

377
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,170
Payback.

378
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,270
Grandpa Rick!

379
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,880
Duh!
You're alive!

380
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,180
Rick! Morty, take this.
You're gonna need it later.

♪

382
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,420
Hold on, hold on.
Whoa!

00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,050
Council Member:
That's enough, Rick.

384
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,820
What... What's this
supposed to accomplish?

385
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,820
We have infinite grandkids.

386
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,790
You're trying to use Disney bucks
at a Caesar's Palace here.

387
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:22,390
That's a bluff.
He's bluffing, sir. He loves me.

388
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,930
You're a rogue Rick...
Irrational, passionate.

389
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,630
You love your grandkids.
You came to rescue them.

390
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,470
I came to kill you, bro.

391
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,000
That's not even
my original Summer.

392
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,840
Oh, my God. He's not bluffing.
He's not bluffing!

393
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,810
R-Rick?
Why not shoot through her?

394
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:37,080
20 yards, nine-gauge
plasma pistol,

395
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,510
My first shot would liquify
her insides and injure you,

396
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:41,180
second shot adds recoil.

397
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,380
The risk to me is minimized
if I wait for you to shoot her,

398
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,780
which I'm encouraging you to do.

399
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,350
What the Or let her go,

400
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,120
which I will reward
with a quicker death.

401
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,720
Because you love her!

402
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,460
Because it's incentive for you
to give me my cleanest shot,

403
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,130
which will be your
least painful death.

404
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:56,630
But if you want to die slower
than that, I'm super into it.

405
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,630
All you got to do to get
that started is kill the girl.

406
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:01,000
I hate you!
Not an issue, sweetie.

407
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,870
That's enough!
Drop the gun, Rick!

408
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,740
Morty, I know you're too stupid
to get this,

409
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,400
but you're really
this up right now.

410
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:08,940
I'm not letting you let my sister die!
Drop the gun!

411
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,940
I wasn't gonna let her die,
you moron!

412

Ha!
Aww.

413
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,780
The point is he <i>thought</i>
I was going to.

414
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,180
I totally did, by the way.

415
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,650
You're a moron, Morty.

416
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:17,950
Morty, you [bleep] idiot!

[bleep] idiot, Morty!

You basically killed us all!

419
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,180
You're the worst! You're
as dumb as a bag of sand.

Who's stupid now, bitch?!

Wow.

Good job, Morty.
Let's go, kids.

Oldest Rick trick in the book.

Awesome! Whoa, cool!

What do you mean? I mean, our single
centralized galactic currency

448
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:38,730
just went from being worth one
of itself to zero of itself.

Their payment is the honor
they'll feel to serve their...

Wait. Who's paying me
to yell at this guy?

For money.

The galactic government
collapsed.

Look, I-I'm not proud to share
this, but the truth is,

Our children, our planet,
our jobs?

Please don't leave me again.
I never will, baby.

I was right.
He turned himself in on purpose.

478

It was all part of his plan!

00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,060
Jerry, is there any
light beer left?

480
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,830
It's insane what you miss
in prison.

481
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,830
Um... okay.
No.

482
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,930
No, no, no.
Foot down time.

483
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,540
No, you're right.
Where's the vodka?

484
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,770
Beth, it's him or me!

485
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,640
Seems like you guys
need some privacy.

486
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,950
I'll, uh...
I'll be in the garage.

487
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,380
What the [bleep]
Not cool, Jerry!

488
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:44,190
A man's garage is his castle.

489
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,530
Jerry's going to...

490
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,600
spend some time...

491
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,870
divorced.

492
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,570
Oh, I-I'm sorry
to hear that, sweetie.

493
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,970
I hope I had nothing
to do with that.

494
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:00,740
Oh, God, Dad, that is not
your burden to bear.

495
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,570
I feel terrible
that I misjudged you.

496
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,380
This is gonna be good for Jerry.

497
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,310
For everybody.
For everybody.

498
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,480
I better tend to Jerry

499
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,120
before he changes his mind
and doesn't move out.

500
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,490
I will leave you two
to your adventures.

501
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:17,190
Oh, my God. Nancy says

502
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,690
they're drawing and quartering
aliens in the school courtyard,

503
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,990
and it technically counts
as patriotism.

504
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,930
Geez! Are my parents seriously
gonna get divorced?

505
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,360
All right, Rick,
I'm gonna go to my...

506
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:28,200
Not so fast, Morty.
You heard your mom.

507
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,770
We've got adventures to go on,
Morty... just you and me...

508
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,840
And sometimes your sister
and sometimes your mom,

509
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,340
but never your dad.

510
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,840
You want to know why, Morty?
Because he crossed me.

511
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,680
Okay, take it easy, Rick.
T-T-That's dark.

512
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,140
Oh, it gets darker, Morty.

513
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:41,110
Welcome to the darkest year
of our adventures.

514
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,650
First thing that's different...
no more Dad, Morty. Oh, geez.

515
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,180
He threatened to turn me in
to the government,

516
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,250
so I made him
and the government go away.

517
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,520
Oh [bleep]

518
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,890
I've replaced them both
as the de facto patriarch

519
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,620
of your family
and your universe.

520
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:54,530
Your mom wouldn't have accepted
me if I came home... Oh, man.

521
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:56,090
Without you and your sister,

522
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,930
so now you know the real
reason I rescued you. Oh!

523
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,500
I just took over the family,
Morty, and if you tell your mom...

524
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,630
Oh, man... or sister I said
any of this, I'll deny it,

525
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,170
You're gonna deny it... and they'll
take my side because I'm a hero, Morty.

526
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,670
And now you're gonna have to go...
Oh.

527
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,340
And do whatever I say,
Morty, forever!

528
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,240
And I'll... I'll go out
and I'll find some more of that

529
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,340
"Mulan" Szechuan teriyaki
dipping sauce, Morty.

530
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,740
What are you talking about? Because that's
that's what this is all about, Morty.

531
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,350
Szechuan?
That's my one-armed man!

532
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,480
I'm not driven by avenging
my dead family, Morty!

533
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,780
That was fake.

534
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,320
I-I-I'm driven by finding
that McNugget sauce.

535
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,620
McNuggets? I want that "Mulan"
McNugget sauce, Morty!

536
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,920
That's my series arc, Morty.
What the hell?

537
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,220
If it takes nine seasons,

538
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,860
I want my McNugget dipping sauce, Szechuan
sauce, Morty. What are you talking about, Rick?

539
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,800
That's what's gonna take us all the way to
the end, Morty. What are you talking about?!

540
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,400
Season... Nine more
seasons, Morty.

541
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,830
Nine more seasons until I get
that dipping Szechuan sauce.

542
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,800
What is that?!
For 97 more years, Morty!

543
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,000
What are you talking about?!

544
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,670
I want that McNugget sauce,
Morty!

545
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:42,270
♪

546
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,070
Is it ready?

547
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,640
Yes.
We can bring it online now.

548
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,040
Do it.

549
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,150
I am Phoenix Person.

550
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,180
Phoenix Person?
Is that what we settled on?

551
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:29,190
I thought we all agreed
on Cyber Bird.

552
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,890
You said you didn't care
what he was called

553
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,420
as long as we brought him back.

554
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,890
Yeah, but Phoenix Person?

555
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:35,490
Fine [bleep] it.
Who cares?

556
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,700
Ka-kaw!
