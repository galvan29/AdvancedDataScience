1
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:05,879
Rick, we did it!
We... We got it!

2
00:00:05,963 --> 00:00:07,507
Hurry up, Morty.
Get in!

3
00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:09,007
- Chachi!
- Fuck Chachi, Morty.

4
00:00:09,091 --> 00:00:11,135
- Did you get it?
- He helped me escape prison.

5
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,513
Did you get the Ultimate Cube?

6
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:14,889
Oh, it's purple.

7
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:16,181
Y-You said it was purple.

8
00:00:16,265 --> 00:00:17,642
I said mine was.

9
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:19,268
I didn't know they all were.

10
00:00:19,393 --> 00:00:21,479
And now we do, thanks to Chichi.

11
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:22,688
Chachi.

12
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:26,484
So, uh, w-w-when do I get it?

13
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,027
Get what, a hug?

14
00:00:28,152 --> 00:00:29,611
Let's find a planet
with a garden hose first.

15
00:00:29,695 --> 00:00:31,155
- A dragon.
- A dragon.

16
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,240
You asked me to cut class
and fight robots with you.

17
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:34,575
I said, "No."

18
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,909
You said, "Millions of lives
depend on it."

19
00:00:35,993 --> 00:00:37,536
I said, "I'll do it
for a dragon."

20
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,038
You said, "Whatever."

21
00:00:39,163 --> 00:00:40,540
I want my dragon.

22
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:42,082
You know who's into dragons, Morty?

23
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:43,917
Nerds that refuse to admit
they're Christian.

24
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:46,044
- I want my dragon.
- Let me give you rocket shoes.

25
00:00:46,128 --> 00:00:47,421
Let me give you Wolverine claws.

26
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:49,214
Let me give you a fucking rocket hat.

27
00:00:49,298 --> 00:00:50,674
Just be sure to use it
with the rocket shoes,

28
00:00:50,758 --> 00:00:52,009
or it'll rip your head off.

29
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:54,011
I want my dragon!
I want my dragon!

30
00:00:54,136 --> 00:00:55,179
I want my dragon!

31
00:00:55,304 --> 00:00:56,889
Oh.

32
00:00:57,014 --> 00:00:58,224
Oh, crap.

33
00:00:58,349 --> 00:00:59,934
Crap.

34
00:01:02,603 --> 00:01:04,397
Dad, are you okay?

35
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:06,190
Your ship crashed in Malta.

36
00:01:06,315 --> 00:01:07,733
I'm okay.

37
00:01:07,858 --> 00:01:10,486
Oh, thank God.

38
00:01:10,611 --> 00:01:12,404
Dad, did you promise Morty a dragon?

39
00:01:12,488 --> 00:01:13,823
Fuuuuuuu...

40
00:01:45,813 --> 00:01:46,856
Ugh!

41
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,108
Bleed here and here.

42
00:01:49,233 --> 00:01:50,318
I'm not co-bleeding.

43
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,111
Under authority of our treaty

44
00:01:52,236 --> 00:01:54,238
'twixt the realms of dragon and man...

45
00:01:54,363 --> 00:01:55,489
Oh, my God, it's my first gay wedding.

46
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:56,866
Summer!

47
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,867
...I hereby bind
this noble serpent and rider

48
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:00,661
at the soul.

49
00:02:00,786 --> 00:02:03,748
Here's your tome of
dragon spells and lore.

50
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:04,998
That'll have everything you need.

51
00:02:05,082 --> 00:02:06,250
Enjoy your dragon.

52
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:08,085
Okay, dragon, here's the house rules.

53
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:11,005
My name is Balthromaw,

54
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,716
breaker of sky, slayer of mountain.

55
00:02:13,841 --> 00:02:16,469
Rule one... You are now scooper
of your own poops,

56
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:19,513
or I will take you down like
the black-light poster you are.

57
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,447
I don't got any more rules.
That's it.

58
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,518
I'm guessing you'd rather not
be tagged in this.

59
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:26,437
Okay, I'll bite.

60
00:02:26,562 --> 00:02:27,896
What's with the talking cat?

61
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,357
It's a dragon, dip knob.

62
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:30,983
I know that's a dragon.

63
00:02:31,108 --> 00:02:33,778
I'm talking about
the talking cat in my bedroom.

64
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,696
Jerry, why would I give Morty
a talking dragon

65
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,489
and you a talking cat at the same time?

66
00:02:37,573 --> 00:02:39,075
Those concepts bump.

67
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,867
If you're talking to a cat,
it's an abnormal event

68
00:02:40,951 --> 00:02:43,120
unrelated to me like
when you went to Pluto

69
00:02:43,245 --> 00:02:44,830
or fucked my daughter.

70
00:02:44,955 --> 00:02:47,249
Okay, there's really no need
to get savage.

71
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,252
So?

72
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:51,920
Eh, he says he has nothing
to do with your talking.

73
00:02:52,004 --> 00:02:54,256
- Told you.
- So then why are you talking?

74
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,633
- Why should that matter?
- Why should it not matter?

75
00:02:56,717 --> 00:02:58,761
How do I know I'm not hallucinating?

76
00:02:58,886 --> 00:03:00,721
Rick said this is an abnormal event.

77
00:03:00,846 --> 00:03:02,931
Do you always need Rick
to tell you what's going on?

78
00:03:03,015 --> 00:03:04,975
Maybe it's time you stopped
asking questions

79
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:07,103
and started having fun.

80
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,646
Oh.

81
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:11,524
Wow, okay.

82
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:12,858
So, what do you want?

83
00:03:12,983 --> 00:03:14,443
I want you to take us to the airport

84
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,904
and get us two
first-class tickets to Florida.

85
00:03:17,029 --> 00:03:20,157
Why, I... I can do that.

86
00:03:22,618 --> 00:03:24,829
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

87
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:27,415
Oh, this is so cool!

88
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,963
I await your next command.

89
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:36,388
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Nobody is commanding anybody.

90
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:39,760
I love soaring through the sky
with you as equals.

91
00:03:39,885 --> 00:03:41,345
W-What do you want to do?

92
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:44,348
I want to enter my lair
and sleep upon my hoard

93
00:03:44,473 --> 00:03:47,184
until the Age of Man expires.

94
00:03:47,309 --> 00:03:48,310
Okay.

95
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:50,020
Split the diff?

96
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:52,940
20-minute nap and soar through the sky?

97
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:54,442
Ugh.

98
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,277
As you command.

99
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,862
Okay, see you soon.

100
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,238
T-This is fun.

101
00:03:59,363 --> 00:04:01,699
Yeah, right.

102
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,076
What's this show called, "Ass"?

103
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:06,704
Yeah, it's like "Bones,"
but they solve ass crimes.

104
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:07,872
<i>This ass is a clue.</i>

105
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,164
Are these two gonna hook up?

106
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:11,292
No, and only the lame fans want that.

107
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,001
Don't tell me how to enjoy things.

108
00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:14,754
- Go to her ass.
- That's Brenner.

109
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,590
Go to Brenner Ass.

110
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:18,883
Honeymoon over already?

111
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,092
What's that supposed to mean?

112
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,802
Admit it, Morty.
Dragons suck.

113
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:23,887
Why don't you admit you don't
anyone else to be happy

114
00:04:23,971 --> 00:04:26,807
because you're a sad old fart?

115
00:04:26,932 --> 00:04:28,392
How do you saddle a fart?

116
00:04:28,517 --> 00:04:29,685
Holy shit.
Look!

117
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:30,936
<i>I love you, Ass.</i>

118
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:32,104
<i>I love you, Brenner.</i>

119
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:33,314
- No.
- Shh.

120
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,107
- Ah!
- Oh!

121
00:04:35,232 --> 00:04:37,526
And that's the end of the
"Morty Gets a Dragon" episode.

122
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,710
Are you gonna slay it?

123
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:41,155
First off, I always slay it, queen.

124
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,198
- Secondly, yes.
- Should I pause "Ass"?

125
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:45,993
Nah, it's kind of boring
now that they're together.

126
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:52,875
Hey, fuckface.

127
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,628
Will you shut the fuck up
or at least roll over?

128
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,755
Oh, no, it burns.

129
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,174
Oh, my God.
Oh, the fire of... of it all.

130
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:02,259
Ah, if only I had prepared better

131
00:05:02,384 --> 00:05:04,094
for this terrifying battle by remembering

132
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:06,180
the only thing dragons are known for.

133
00:05:13,437 --> 00:05:15,064
Careful you don't get heartburn.

134
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:17,149
I made that android with a lot of C4.

135
00:05:17,274 --> 00:05:18,859
Oh, I'm sorry.
I imbued it with

136
00:05:18,984 --> 00:05:21,612
a remote-controlled explode-y potion.

137
00:05:21,737 --> 00:05:23,322
You have bested me.

138
00:05:23,447 --> 00:05:25,157
I am at your service.

139
00:05:25,282 --> 00:05:26,783
Good to be on the same parchment.

140
00:05:26,867 --> 00:05:28,452
Now, I'm gonna tell
my grandson you ran off

141
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:31,664
with a low-flying 747
while you pack up your...

142
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,939
Wait, is this...
Why do you have an original

143
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,752
Ecto Cooler juice box from 1989?

144
00:05:36,877 --> 00:05:39,588
I hoard that which your kind covets.

145
00:05:39,713 --> 00:05:42,633
- Give you 20 bucks for it.
- Nice try.

146
00:05:42,758 --> 00:05:44,259
What the hell else
are you hoarding down here?

147
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:46,637
Cha-ching.
"Small Soldiers" Spin Pops?

148
00:05:46,762 --> 00:05:48,472
- Don't open that.
- I'm not an idiot.

149
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:51,517
Hey, why do you have Future's
self-titled album on vinyl?

150
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,102
Look closer.

151
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,854
Oh, shit.
He signed it.

152
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,730
Closer.

153
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,774
He signed it in molly and Percocet?

154
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:00,233
I could spend all night down here.

155
00:06:00,317 --> 00:06:03,153
Do you indulge in volcanic fumes?

156
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,739
Is it gonna fuck up my brain?

157
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,534
- No.
- I'll do it anyway.

158
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:11,495
Hoo, those were not cheap tickets,

159
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,332
but, um, I'm down to clown.

160
00:06:15,457 --> 00:06:18,043
Uh, w-w-w-why can you talk again, uh?

161
00:06:18,168 --> 00:06:19,377
It's not important, Jerry.

162
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:20,796
Okay, but why Florida?

163
00:06:20,921 --> 00:06:22,590
Because they don't ask questions.

164
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,925
They play volleyball,
they party, and they have fun.

165
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,552
Right, right.

166
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:27,827
You can do this, Jerry.

167
00:06:27,928 --> 00:06:31,181
I can do this.
I can do this.

168
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:34,476
Ugh!

169
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,645
Oh, yeah.

170
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,480
Hey, Jerry, after this game,

171
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,190
come to my yacht and bring your cat.

172
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:41,734
You got it, Jipe.

173
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:43,569
I got to admit, you were right.

174
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,362
I've got to tell you something, Jerry.

175
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:48,096
This is the happiest I've ever
been in my entire life.

176
00:06:48,198 --> 00:06:50,534
Oh, gross!
Who shit in the sand?

177
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:53,162
Someone took a small shit in the sand

178
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,205
and buried it with, like,
two little kicks

179
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,416
and just left it here like a land mine.

180
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,668
Why and who?

181
00:06:59,793 --> 00:07:01,837
It was him.

182
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,758

190
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,654
Yeah.
He's, uh, texting me.

191
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,906
Hmm.
How are you responding?

192
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,324
Ugh, I tend not to,

193
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:32,868
or maybe I'll send, like,
a popular animated GIF

194
00:07:32,993 --> 00:07:34,911
that could be interpreted
in almost any way.

195
00:07:34,995 --> 00:07:35,996
Brilliant.

196
00:07:36,121 --> 00:07:37,957
I summon thee.

197
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:41,669
I summon thee, Balthromaw.

198
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,045
What the hell?

199
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,171
Taylor Swift pumping her hands
in the air?

200
00:07:45,255 --> 00:07:46,965
- What does it mean when...
- It means you're lame.

"Orcs work to live.
Dwarves live to work."

209
00:08:08,195 --> 00:08:09,279
So dumb.

210
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:10,614
If there's ever a saying about me,

211
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,908
I'll fly into the fucking Sun.

212
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:18,414
Oh, you're small for a dragon, Rick.

213
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,957
Well, I sleep on an extra big
pile of awesome shit.

214
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,293
Then there will be sayings about you.

215
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,838
Your lessers will hunt you down,

216
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:29,049
and you will be owned or slain.

217
00:08:29,174 --> 00:08:31,677
That's why they call it
a dying breed, brother.

218
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,265
Ugh! Ugh!

219
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,100
Oh, God, ugh.

220
00:08:38,225 --> 00:08:39,435
- My soul.
- Oh!

221
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,311
Oh, yeah.
I'm...

222
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:42,938
I'm... I'm a dragon.

223
00:08:43,063 --> 00:08:44,398
Oh!
Ugh, I'm bonding.

224
00:08:44,523 --> 00:08:45,816
I'm bonding too.

225
00:08:45,941 --> 00:08:48,360
- Oh!
- Yeah.

226
00:08:48,485 --> 00:08:49,653
What the fuck?

227
00:08:49,778 --> 00:08:50,863
Morty, I can explain.

228
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,031
Stop!

229
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,490
Why are you still doing it?

230
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,325
Why does it feel better now?

231
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,369
I hope it's not because you're
watching but don't go anywhere.

232
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,371
How did you find us?

233
00:08:59,496 --> 00:09:03,333
We followed the smell
of sulfur and skankery.

234
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,669
- Oh!
- Oh, yeah.

235
00:09:05,794 --> 00:09:07,963
- Oh, man, ugh.
- Fuck this.

236
00:09:08,088 --> 00:09:10,423
You can take this stupid
fake soul-bond contract,

237
00:09:10,507 --> 00:09:13,177
and you can... Mm!
Ah!

238
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,553
No refunds.

239
00:09:14,678 --> 00:09:16,930
Your dragon soul-bonded with my grandpa.

240
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,391
Oh, my!
I am so sorry.

241
00:09:19,516 --> 00:09:21,101
That is a total violation.

242
00:09:21,226 --> 00:09:22,227
Yeah, no shit.

243
00:09:22,352 --> 00:09:24,063
I'll take care of this at once.

244
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,355
You slut dragon!

245
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:26,439
- What the fuck?
- You slut.

246
00:09:26,523 --> 00:09:27,565
- Chill out, dude.
- Slut!

247
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:28,733
- Okay, that's...
- You slut!

248
00:09:28,817 --> 00:09:30,068
- Y-You don't have to...
- Slut!

249
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,320
Shame on you!

250
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:32,988
Shame, you slut!
You slutty, slutty slut!

251
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,864
Ow! Why the fuck does it feel
like you're whipping me?

252
00:09:34,948 --> 00:09:37,076
Because your soul got tangled

253
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,494
- in a dirty...
- Ah!

254
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:39,620
- ...slutty...
- Ow!

255
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:40,996
- ...slut soul!
- Ow!

256
00:09:41,121 --> 00:09:42,122
- Let's go!
- Ow! Ow!

257
00:09:42,247 --> 00:09:43,697
Get to that portal, you slut.

258
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,001
Grandpa, do something, or I will tweet,

259
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:48,253
and you will be canceled.

260
00:09:48,378 --> 00:09:51,528
Hey, Dandruff the Great, lighten
up and give the kid his dragon.

261
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:52,800
By whose command?

262
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,051
You have no magic.

263
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:56,011
Yeah, I know.
I have actual power.

264
00:09:56,136 --> 00:09:57,387
Not here, you don't.

265
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:00,349
True power looks like this...

266
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,559
Stone monster.

267
00:10:02,684 --> 00:10:05,104
- Stick that up your ass.
- Oh, you're done?

268
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:08,232
I thought the rock monster was
here to introduce a physicist.

269
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,904
Spinal cord, uh, activate morphine.

270
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:16,156
Oh, I might be fucked.

271
00:10:16,281 --> 00:10:18,033
Lightning bridge!

272
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:21,619
Okay, he's gone.
Listen up.

273
00:10:21,703 --> 00:10:23,204
There's probably animals in these hills.

274
00:10:23,288 --> 00:10:25,373
If you spare me, I can make
your crotch a salt lick.

275
00:10:25,457 --> 00:10:29,586
Agana aksaka sapooloo.

276
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,215
Thank you, Morty.

277
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,551
Figures you'd be higher status
in Lame World.

278
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,427
Get your shit together, Lair Wrecker.

279
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,096
We need to rescue Balthromaw.

280
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:42,099
Morty, the moral of this story
is bros before dragons.

281
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,767
You know what I'm talking about?

282
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:46,478
Yeah, if he dies while
you're soul bonded, you die too.

283
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:49,982
Morty, the moral of this story
is bros rescue dragons.

284
00:10:51,316 --> 00:10:53,402
Balthromaw, by soul bonding

285
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,154
with multiple riders,

286
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,532
you have violated the treaty
between dragon and mankind.

287
00:10:58,657 --> 00:11:02,911
The Dragonarchy sentences you
to hang by the neck until dead.

288
00:11:03,036 --> 00:11:04,705
On the count of three.

289
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,665
One Dragonarchy,

290
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,876
two Dragonarchy,

291
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,253
2½... I just wanted to make sure...

292
00:11:11,378 --> 00:11:13,338
Three!

293
00:11:13,463 --> 00:11:15,549
Grandpa Rick, what's wrong?

294
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:18,302
Oh, God. The wizard must have
hung Balthromaw!

295
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,011
Well, fuck it.
Can we go back then?

296
00:11:20,095 --> 00:11:22,013
W-Well, no, no.
It takes, like, 78 years

297
00:11:22,097 --> 00:11:23,389
to hang a dragon to death, so...

298
00:11:23,473 --> 00:11:25,142
Aw, man.
It's so annoying.

299
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,644
You ever, like, try to swallow
a really big vitamin

300
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,104
with no water?
Ugh!

301
00:11:29,229 --> 00:11:30,522
You know, like

302
00:11:30,647 --> 00:11:32,316
really, like, big one, you know,

303
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:35,402
and it kind of gets,
ugh, stuck in your throat?

304
00:11:35,527 --> 00:11:36,778
It's... It's annoying.
All right.

305
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,114
Morty, go ahead and activate this golem.

306
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:41,366
Agana aksaka sapooloo.

307
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,173
Fucking dumb.
All right.

308
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,883
Who wants to be infused with,
like, uh, unreasonable power?

309
00:11:58,967 --> 00:12:01,010
Oh, can I be, like,
a sexy arrow-shooty lady?

310
00:12:01,094 --> 00:12:04,139
Yeah, whatever.
There's no rules. I don't care.

311
00:12:04,264 --> 00:12:06,099
Morty, you want superpowers?

312
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,101
No, thanks. I'm fine.
I've got my book.

313
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:09,685
All right.
Good luck with that.

314
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,271
Let's go.

315
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,233
God, it's like...

316
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:15,441
Have you ever had too much orange juice,

317
00:12:15,525 --> 00:12:16,943
or, like, you know how egg yolk

318
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,611
kind of, like, gets in your throat?

319
00:12:18,695 --> 00:12:19,613
Yeah, we get it.

320
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:20,781
Come on and hurry.

321
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,324
W-We got to free Balthromaw.

322
00:12:22,449 --> 00:12:24,159
- Upsulu...
- I got this.

323
00:12:28,163 --> 00:12:29,914
Morty, how's that book
working out for you,

324
00:12:29,998 --> 00:12:31,917
you fucking d-d-dumb-ass?

325
00:12:34,461 --> 00:12:36,713
Huh. You know what?
You're right.

326
00:12:36,838 --> 00:12:38,688
I could get used to this magic stuff.

327
00:12:47,182 --> 00:12:49,059
There's Balthromaw.

328
00:12:49,184 --> 00:12:50,518
Check this shit out.
Watch this.

329
00:12:50,602 --> 00:12:51,561
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Don't even look.

330
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:52,896
Don't even bother looking.

331
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,731
Just fucking let magic guide your arrow.

332
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,650
Summer, what the hell are you doing?

333
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:59,236
- Take this seriously.
- Shut the fuck up, Morty.

334
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,446
Stop trying to pretend like
magic involves skill or thought.

335
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,615
Summer, make it look like it's
coming out of your butthole.

336
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,075
Yeah, yeah.

337
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,077
Ah!

338
00:13:07,202 --> 00:13:09,871
Oh, fuck, my fucking eye, oh!

339
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:12,666
What in the Medieval
equivalent of tarnation...

340
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,835
Jesus Christ!

341
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,461
Summer, you fucking idiot!

342
00:13:16,586 --> 00:13:18,422
Power of 12 feet.

343
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:19,506
Uh, ow, fuck!

344
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:20,841
I take it all back!

345
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,926
I fucking hate magic!

346
00:13:26,638 --> 00:13:27,556
Ah!

347
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:28,640
Slut thief!

348
00:13:28,765 --> 00:13:30,809
You're a slut thief!

349
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:36,106
Pretty fun boat, fun people.

350
00:13:36,231 --> 00:13:39,443
That's great, not being asked
why I can talk.

351
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:43,113
I'm a talking cat, but
"Who cares why?" is my point.

352
00:13:43,238 --> 00:13:46,283
Well, nice talking to you for no reason.

353
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,786
Jorge, that was a good one,

354
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,537
but do you know what
a peanut butter gargoyle is?

355
00:13:51,621 --> 00:13:52,831
Nah, what's that?

356
00:13:52,956 --> 00:13:54,791
Dude, it's when you take the chick,

357
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,834
- put her feet on a cathedral...
- Sorry to interrupt, guys.

358
00:13:56,918 --> 00:13:59,671
Just want to clarify,
are these real sex positions?

359
00:13:59,796 --> 00:14:01,214
Because if they are,

360
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,759
how are they gratifying
to the male at all?

361
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,677
And if the goal is to make something up,

362
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:09,723
why not make up
something... funnier?

363
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:12,851
I'm asking too many questions, aren't I?

364
00:14:12,976 --> 00:14:14,227
How ironic.

365
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,354
Get out of Florida, you overthinking cat.

366
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:18,439
Why don't you go overthink shit
up north in Georgia?

367
00:14:18,523 --> 00:14:19,733
Hate that cat.

368
00:14:29,576 --> 00:14:31,119
You got any money for a cab?

369
00:14:31,244 --> 00:14:32,579
Why ask questions?

370
00:14:32,704 --> 00:14:34,289
Why not just have fun?

371
00:14:34,414 --> 00:14:35,791
I deserve that.

372
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,543
Attention, citizens of Draygon,

373
00:14:38,668 --> 00:14:41,296
a slut dragon has escaped.

374
00:14:41,421 --> 00:14:44,674
Anyone caught harboring it
is also a slut.

375
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,301
- That's how it goes.
- Ow, my eye.

376
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:49,179
It pains me that you can feel my pain.

377
00:14:49,304 --> 00:14:50,596
Yeah, how about you suck your dick,

378
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,391
which is also somehow my dick?

379
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:55,811
Aw, why can't couples that start
out cheating ever end up happy?

380
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,937
M-Maybe I can find
that wizard's portal spell

381
00:14:58,021 --> 00:14:59,321
in here and g-get us home.

382
00:14:59,439 --> 00:15:01,024
How about finding the spell
that unbinds me

383
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,358
from your fucking dragon?

384
00:15:02,442 --> 00:15:04,319
No spells can do that.

385
00:15:04,444 --> 00:15:06,488
Only the wizard can unbind soul bonds.

386
00:15:06,613 --> 00:15:07,863
Uh, who the fuck are you?

387
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,657
Who are we?
Who the fuck are you, bitch?

388
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:12,035
Debrah, stop.
We are the slut dragons.

389
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,120
We live in these slut caves
where we fuck,

390
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:17,124
suck, and eat butt, and
we kindly ask that you leave.

391
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,542
If the wizard knows we are here,
he will imprison us.

392
00:15:19,626 --> 00:15:21,002
Yeah!
We like it down here

393
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,296
'cause we can fuck
woolly mammoths. Get out!

394
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,339
Get the fuck out of here, Michael!

395
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,298
Shut up, Michael!

396
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,341
You're the only one
that fucks that thing.

397
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,592
Get the fuck out of here.

398
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,344
Well, at least I'm not into shit play.

399
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,578
- Fuck you!
- Hey, wait!

400
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,180
Everybody stop, stop!

401
00:15:32,305 --> 00:15:33,890
Listen, this is all my fault.

402
00:15:34,015 --> 00:15:36,517
I started all this when
I tried to control Balthromaw,

403
00:15:36,601 --> 00:15:37,751
and that was fucked up.

404
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,312
Nobody should control anyone,

405
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,888
especially that guy up there.

406
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,358
And, um, you can eat butt
if you want, I guess.

407
00:15:43,483 --> 00:15:44,609
- I, uh...
- I got this, Morty.

408
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,278
Okay, listen up, slut dragons!

409
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,237
Wouldn't you rather be sluts up there,

410
00:15:48,321 --> 00:15:50,657
have a fuck world instead of a fuck cave?

411
00:15:50,782 --> 00:15:52,159
What's wrong with you?

412
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,243
This man with a ponytail
makes a valid point.

413
00:15:54,327 --> 00:15:57,038
All dragons are sluts deep down,
even the ones up above,

414
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,165
but we would have to kill
the wizard to be free.

415
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,417
He is too powerful.

416
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:03,128
There is a way to kill the wizard.

417
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,754
Whoa.
Who's this mysterious character?

418
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,464
Shadow Jacker, you haven't come out

419
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:08,248
of your masturbation cave in eons.

420
00:16:08,341 --> 00:16:11,553
It's high time I emerge
from my cum cocoon.

421
00:16:11,678 --> 00:16:13,888
I grow tired of eavesdropping
and masturbating

422
00:16:13,972 --> 00:16:15,139
to the sounds you all make.

423
00:16:15,223 --> 00:16:16,433
Jesus Christ.
All right.

424
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:17,600
C-Could use a little more mystery.

425
00:16:17,684 --> 00:16:19,352
Oh, oh, just now seeing the staff.

426
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:22,564
We've never had enough sluts
to defeat the wizard.

427
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:25,108
Now, with the four fresh, wet sluts that

428
00:16:25,233 --> 00:16:28,570
just landed on our doorstep,
we finally have a chance.

429
00:16:28,695 --> 00:16:30,780
So killing the wizard
will break my soul bond.

430
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:33,074
Yes, it solves all of our problems.

431
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,202
We must begin a 10-slut soul orgy...

432
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,870
Wait, wait, what?

433
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:39,414
...and become the all-slut
slut phoenix dragon, Slut.

434
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,790
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on. Hold on.

435
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,458
There's got to be something else in here.

436
00:16:42,542 --> 00:16:43,960
There's got to be another way.
Just give me a second.

437
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,670
I haven't read all this yet.

438
00:16:49,424 --> 00:16:51,474
Maybe don't tell your parents
we did this?

439
00:17:15,742 --> 00:17:18,245
Oh, oh, no.
Oh... Wait, please, no!

440
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,621
Ice spell!
Ice spell!

441
00:17:19,746 --> 00:17:21,706
Oh, God!

442
00:17:21,831 --> 00:17:23,333
That just made it last longer.

443
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:24,960
Ah, it burns longer!

444
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,003
Ah, I could have died fast!

445
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,509
Thank you, strangers.

446
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,135
Well, it's your world now.
Have fun with empowerment.

447
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,095
It seems to make everyone
that gets it really happy.

448
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:39,140
All right, guys.
I'll use this to open a portal.

449
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:41,851
Uh, open a portal to Earth.

450
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,686
Let's get the hell out of here fast.

451
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,354
God, look at this piece of shit.

452
00:17:45,438 --> 00:17:47,938
Why is there writing on it?
Who writes on a portal?

453
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,695
Should've taken me up on those
Wolverine claws instead, Morty.

454
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:54,279
Wait, why did the dragon come?

455
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,533
I was thinking we could hang out?

456
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,535
Oh, yeah.
Whoa, Jesus.

457
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,411
Your dad's been texting me
this whole time?

458
00:18:00,495 --> 00:18:02,079
Uh, he's at an airport with a cat.

459
00:18:02,163 --> 00:18:03,748
Okay, that... that sounds... Wow.

460
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,082
You know, I better check on him.

461
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,751
Big season finale right there, you know?

462
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,419
Better, uh... Better go right now.

463
00:18:08,503 --> 00:18:10,296
Also, I told you not
to get a dragon, Morty.

464
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,131
This is your fault.
Fuck you, worst adventure ever.

465
00:18:12,215 --> 00:18:13,758
Worst adventure ever.

466
00:18:13,883 --> 00:18:16,719
Yeah, uh, I guess you better be
on your way too, Balthromaw.

467
00:18:16,803 --> 00:18:18,555
Well, I've been thinking.

468
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,100
What you said back there in the
cave really resonated with me.

469
00:18:22,225 --> 00:18:23,852
Maybe we could try again?

470
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,353
Look, to be honest,
I'm kind of grossed out

471
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,647
with the sexual nature
of how everything unfolded.

472
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:29,565
I didn't know how sexual dragons were.

473
00:18:29,649 --> 00:18:31,943
I kind of just wanted to do
some D&D stuff, you know?

474
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:34,195
And have a soul orgy
with your sister and grandpa

475
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,947
and every dragon we could find, yeah?

476
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,907
No, look, can you please just go?

477
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,433
I-I-I really want to shower.

478
00:18:39,534 --> 00:18:41,285
Maybe a quick soul bone before I go.

479
00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:42,537
I-I-I-I'm good.

480
00:18:42,662 --> 00:18:43,913
I think I just need to be alone

481
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,874
and sort of un... unpack all this.

482
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,208
What about your grandpa?

483
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,668
Would he want to?
I can wait.

484
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,052
No, I think you better go.

485
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,755
I-I'm gonna take that shower.

486
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,423
If it's just warm liquid you
want trickled over your body,

487
00:18:54,507 --> 00:18:55,758
- I could maybe...
- No, no, look.

488
00:18:55,842 --> 00:18:57,177
I just want to be clean!

489
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,178
I-I-I feel dirty after
everything that's happened.

490
00:18:59,262 --> 00:19:02,223
How about a quick hand bond?

491
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,016
- I like doing it.
- You're embarrassing yourself.

492
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,769
I-I-I'm closing the door.

493
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:08,813
Fucking soul teasers.

494
00:19:08,938 --> 00:19:11,024
This is a cool car.
I like having fun.

495
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:12,942
That's what I'm talking about.
Keep it moving.

496
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,277
Don't ask why I can talk.

497
00:19:14,402 --> 00:19:15,987
- Mm, mm, mm.
- Uh-huh.

498
00:19:16,112 --> 00:19:18,531
For sure. For sure.

499
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,075
Where are we going?

500
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,300
Quantum radiator might need
some nanowater.

501
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,287
We... We can stretch our legs.

502
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:33,046
So, uh, why can you talk?

503
00:19:33,171 --> 00:19:34,547
What is this?

504
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,925
I need you in one spot
for a clean mind scan.

505
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,135
Mind scan?
Look, you're overthinking it.

506
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,137
The point of a talking cat
is to have fun.

507
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,472
I find the insinuation that
I can't ask questions

508
00:19:43,556 --> 00:19:45,100
<i>and</i> have fun condescending.

509
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,851
Y-You find it condescending, Jerry?

510
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:47,852
Yes.

511
00:19:47,977 --> 00:19:49,312
All right.
I'm from outer space.

512
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,605
- Happy?
- No.

513
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,940
Exactly, because no answer
would be satisfying.

514
00:19:53,024 --> 00:19:53,983
Because it's a lie.

515
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,403
Let's see the truth.

516
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:57,529
What in the...

517
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,409
Oh, son of a bitch.

518
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:03,951
- Jerry, don't.
- I want to see.

519
00:20:04,035 --> 00:20:05,954
No, you do not.

520
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:11,251
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

521
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,586
At least now maybe...

522
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:14,754
Get the hell out of here!

523
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:15,755
But I've got nowhere to go.

524
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:16,881
- Get out!
- Get out!

525
00:20:17,006 --> 00:20:17,882
Get out!

526
00:20:26,182 --> 00:20:30,395
He was in my home where
I keep photos of my parents.

527
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,604
Jerry, I have a device.

528
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:32,981
I-It can make us forget.

529
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:35,775
No, I don't think we should forget,

530
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,318
not this.

531
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,487
Someone has to remember.

532
00:20:39,612 --> 00:20:41,197
Someone will.

533
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:44,492
Did we crash?

534
00:20:44,617 --> 00:20:45,535
Where's the cat?

535
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,495
He, uh, ran away.

536
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,581
- Did you scan his brain?
- Yeah.

537
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:50,998
Did you find out why he can talk?

538
00:20:51,082 --> 00:20:52,834
He's from outer space.

539
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:54,961
Outer space?

540
00:20:55,086 --> 00:20:56,588
That little...

541
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:59,966
Of course, total mind fuck.

542
00:21:35,835 --> 00:21:37,629
Now, that's what I call draggin'.

543
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,422
- What?
- It's a joke.

544
00:21:39,547 --> 00:21:41,382
You're a dragon draggin' your stuff.

545
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:42,926
I understand.

546
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,761
So, how you doing?

547
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,846
I grow weary of you humans.

548
00:21:46,971 --> 00:21:49,182
How about 50 bucks?
You weary of 50 bucks?

549
00:21:49,307 --> 00:21:50,766
I'm trying to cheat on my wife.

550
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,810
I'm looking for a little magic,
a little fantasy.

551
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,854
You could use some help.
Let's help each other, huh?

552
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:55,980
50 bucks.

553
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,151
Slut!

554
00:22:00,276 --> 00:22:01,986
Nice.

555
00:22:02,111 --> 00:22:03,529
Is there a reason you can speak?

556
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:06,241
Yeah, and I'm ashamed of it.

557
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,743
Then speak of it no more.

558
00:22:08,868 --> 00:22:11,830
Do you wish to eat, maybe bond a little?

559
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,832
Yeah, I could bond.

560
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:16,107
How long does it take you
to fly to Florida?
