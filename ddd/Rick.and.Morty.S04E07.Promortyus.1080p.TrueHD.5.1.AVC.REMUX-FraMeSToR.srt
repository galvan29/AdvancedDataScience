1
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,976
Aah, aah!

2
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:26,108
Oh, my God.

3
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:27,443
Holy shit. Oh.

4
00:00:27,568 --> 00:00:28,735
What are... What are these things?!

5
00:00:28,819 --> 00:00:30,196
Do I look like I know?

6
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:32,239
Last thing I remember, I was,
ugh, in a cave

7
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:34,450
looking at some wet egg and...
Oh, that probably did it.

8
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:35,784
I told you not to look at that egg!

9
00:00:35,868 --> 00:00:37,078
I-It was too wet.

10
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,454
You don't get to tell me what to look at.

11
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:39,746
I've seen your Pornhub account.

12
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,373
Also, who makes a Pornhub account?

13
00:00:41,457 --> 00:00:43,625
The algorithm learns your
preferences better that way.

14
00:00:43,709 --> 00:00:45,502
Plus if you get in kind
of a cool enough relationship,

15
00:00:45,586 --> 00:00:47,129
you can sort of follow each other

16
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,547
and check out
each other's kinks, you know?

17
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,174
Alright, God damn, sold.

18
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:51,592
- How do we get out of here?
- Morty, relax.

19
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:53,469
They're face-hugging parasites.

20
00:00:53,594 --> 00:00:56,594
I don't think their society's
gonna be that hard to navigate.

21
00:00:57,723 --> 00:01:00,685
Okay, yeah, this might be
a little harder than I thought.

22
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,479
Holy shit.
They've got an M&M's store.

23
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:39,848
This is bad, Rick.
Th-Th-Th-Th-This is really bad.

24
00:01:39,932 --> 00:01:41,267
Just be cool, Morty.

25
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:42,559
All we gotta do is blend in,
find our ship,

26
00:01:42,643 --> 00:01:44,478
and get the fuck outta here.

27
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,230
Alright, Morty, here's the plan,
put this back on your face.

28
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:47,898
I-I'm not putting that back on my face!

29
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:48,899
Relax. It's dead.

30
00:01:51,193 --> 00:01:52,570
Okay, now it's dead.

31
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:55,406
Come on, hurry up.

32
00:01:55,531 --> 00:01:56,448
Rick, i-it's bleeding.

33
00:01:56,532 --> 00:01:57,908
I-It's bleeding acid.

34
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,451
Alright, well, that should
be the last of it.

35
00:01:59,535 --> 00:02:01,829
If not, then just gimme
two tugs on the arm.

36
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:07,251
Seems like a self-destructive life cycle.

37
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,669
Is that gonna happen to us?

38
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,128
You feel an egg in your stomach?

39
00:02:10,212 --> 00:02:13,049
- No.
- Well, glass half full.

40
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,216
- How's it going?
- 'Sup.

41
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,592
- Glory to Glorzo.
- Totally.

42
00:02:15,676 --> 00:02:16,802
Love Glorzo.

43
00:02:16,927 --> 00:02:18,429
<i>Glorzo is peace.</i>

44
00:02:18,554 --> 00:02:20,014
<i>Peace is Glorzo.</i>

45
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:22,433
Wow, just cogs in the machine, y'know?

46
00:02:22,558 --> 00:02:24,268
- Ma-Makes you think...
- Yeah, I'm sure you'll make this

47
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,228
into a beautiful short film
that your parents'll pay for,

48
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,313
Morty, but right now, we really
just need to find my ship.

49
00:02:28,397 --> 00:02:29,940
You sure you're not just jealous?

50
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:32,150
Looks like I'm kind of
a celebrity around here.

51
00:02:32,234 --> 00:02:33,903
<i>The future is Glorzo!</i>

52
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:36,781
Oh, my God.
I was just reading you.

53
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,241
Congratulations on making it
into print media.

54
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:40,868
Real bright future there.

55
00:02:40,993 --> 00:02:42,828
Honestly, it's shocking to see
the two of you together.

56
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,789
Because we're both geniuses?

57
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,582
No, because I've seen your videos,

58
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,292
and you make me fucking sick.

59
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:50,002
Fix him.

60
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,547
Glory to Glorzo.

61
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:54,923
Sir, you shouldn't wander off like that.

62
00:02:55,007 --> 00:02:56,300
We've been looking all over for you.

63
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,884
The project is ready for your approval.

64
00:02:57,968 --> 00:02:59,553
Sir, is this man bothering you?

65
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,055
Um, no, h-he's fine.

66
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,848
Uh, what... what project?

67
00:03:02,973 --> 00:03:05,351
Jesus Christ, who the fuck was I?

68
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:08,896
<i>Here's a scientific fact
I'm not allowed to say...</i>

69
00:03:09,021 --> 00:03:13,150
<i>Our hosts are biologically
designed to incubate our eggs.</i>

70
00:03:13,275 --> 00:03:15,403
<i>If that "triggers" you, fuck off.</i>

71
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,987
<i>If it doesn't, please like and subscribe.</i>

72
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,781
<i>New videos every Glorzday.</i>

73
00:03:18,906 --> 00:03:20,491
God, was I at least rich?

74
00:03:20,616 --> 00:03:22,200
I mean, d-d-did I at least sell out

75
00:03:22,284 --> 00:03:23,702
and sell vitamins or something?

76
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,203
Rick, I've watched enough Pornhub to know

77
00:03:25,287 --> 00:03:26,705
what a studio apartment looks like.

78
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,207
God damn.

79
00:03:28,332 --> 00:03:30,668
Jesus, your Glorzo got shit done.

80
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:33,421
My lord, we await your command.

81
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,505
Oh, to

82
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,215
shoot it?
A-At people?

83
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,675
Glorzo is peace.

84
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,343
All shall be made Glorzo.

85
00:03:39,468 --> 00:03:41,303
Glory to Glorzo.

86
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:42,930
I... did this?

87
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:46,434
You and the amazing technology
you both brought us.

88
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,810
Yeah, makes sense.

89
00:03:47,935 --> 00:03:49,061
A-And where was this heading?

90
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,187
Earth?
Probably Earth?

91
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,814
The humans
call it "Earth."

92
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:54,066
Yeah, well, okay,
first of all, great work.

93
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:55,984
You guys obviously put a lot
of work into this.

94
00:03:56,068 --> 00:03:57,568
- Okay.
- And y'know, it shows.

95
00:03:57,653 --> 00:03:59,613
I-It really shows.
But um...

96
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,073
I-I've been thinking, and, you know,

97
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,200
maybe we should just call this off.

98
00:04:03,325 --> 00:04:04,869
Sorry, is... is there more?

99
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,120
Nope, nope.

100
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:08,038
I-I guess, uh, that... that's it.

101
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:11,000
Just don't Glorzo Earth.

102
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,711
Just would've been nice
to have heard this sooner

103
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,379
before we spent all day on it.

104
00:04:15,504 --> 00:04:17,506
Yeah, well, I-I'm just hearing
about it, too.

105
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,966
- You ordered it.
- Right.

106
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:20,634
I-I did, and, um...

107
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,344
I'm just saying for next time,
maybe put more thought

108
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,096
into it before a whole day of...

109
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:26,139
Okay, well, I'm sorry I made you
do your job for a fucking day!

110
00:04:26,223 --> 00:04:27,474
You look like you were all really busy

111
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,059
before I came and fucked it all up.

112
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:30,227
Boy, oh boy, huh?
This guy's a genius, but at...

113
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:31,478
But at what price, you know?

114
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:32,688
Y'know, fuck you, Rick!

115
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,024
Who's... Rick?

116
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,650
Yeah, well, if we're free
to ask questions,

117
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:39,361
why haven't you blinked,
uh, for 20 minutes,

118
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:42,948
and why, uh, doesn't
your mouth move when you talk?

119
00:04:45,284 --> 00:04:46,994
Ah, geez, look at me.

120
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:48,912
I-I feel down on... on... on the floor.

121
00:04:48,996 --> 00:04:51,373
Oh, let... let me, uh, help...
Help you out here, buddy.

122
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,667
Ah, thanks, man.
Thanks, pal. That's right.

123
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:57,004
I'm right back where... where...
Right back in the saddle here.

124
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,884
Alright, fuck it, run.

125
00:05:24,156 --> 00:05:25,991
I-I hate this!
I hate all of this!

126
00:05:26,116 --> 00:05:27,451
Yeah, yeah, keep that feedback
coming, Morty.

127
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,286
It can only help.

128
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:36,126
- Oh, shit.
- Aw, man!

129
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,753
How big is this city?!

130
00:05:37,878 --> 00:05:39,171
I know, it's like pick a lane.

131
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,205
Are you face huggers or industrialists?

132
00:05:44,134 --> 00:05:46,261
Damn, feels kinda good
when there's no guilt, huh?

133
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:47,679
Yeah, it's...
It's like in "Star Wars."

134
00:05:47,763 --> 00:05:48,972
Yeah, just like
in "Star Wars."

135
00:05:49,056 --> 00:05:50,891
Go nuts!

136
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,563
<i>Nice, Morty! Give a little
"yee-haw" if you want.</i>

137
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,440
<i>They... They always do a little
"yee-haw" like a cowboy.</i>

138
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,649
Yee... Yee-ha... Yee-haw.

139
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:01,235
<i>Good enough.</i>

140
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:12,454
God, I needed this.

141
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,080
Honestly, it's been a while
since I've been able

142
00:06:14,164 --> 00:06:15,332
to just let loose, you know?

143
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,834
<i>Just have fun.
I'm... I'm...</i>

144
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,502
<i>I'm sorry if I've been
taking it out on you.</i>

145
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,754
No, I get it. You got a lot
on your plate, amigo.

146
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,172
I-I just wish you'd open up

147
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,507
to me more about it sometimes, you know?

148
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,008
- I-I-I'm your partner.
- Thanks, Morty.

149
00:06:25,092 --> 00:06:26,468
I mean that.
Thank you.

150
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:27,969
Sometimes, I get a little
in my head, you know?

151
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:29,596
Hey, man, that head's a good place to be.

152
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,723
Just remember to let me
in sometimes, you know?

153
00:06:31,807 --> 00:06:34,018
Will do, buddy.
Motherfucker.

154
00:06:38,063 --> 00:06:39,606
Oh, my God, this is so much fun!

155
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,858
I don't want to stop!

156
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,783
Yeah, it's like popping bubble wrap.

157
00:06:52,244 --> 00:06:53,954
Honestly, I'm proud of us for not.

158
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,748
Totally.
It would've been cheap.

159
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:58,673
Yeah, real low-hanging fruit,
and we're better than that.

160
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:02,254
Pearl Harbor, on the other hand...

161
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:04,423
Yeah, I think that's in-bounds.

162
00:07:08,677 --> 00:07:09,929
I am the god of death!

163
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,264
Should've been a better species!

164
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,981
So, you did a 9/11?

165
00:07:21,106 --> 00:07:22,358
Almost did a 9/11.

166
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,942
We... We went with a Pearl Harbor.

167
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,152
We're pretty classy.

168
00:07:25,277 --> 00:07:27,363
Why were either of those an option?

169
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:28,530
Ask the Saudis.

170
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:29,657
Wow. Damn.

171
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,075
Yeah, getting political.

172
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,701
I'm political now.
How 'bout you, Jerry?

173
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,120
You got anything to add
to the family dynamic?

174
00:07:35,245 --> 00:07:37,539
I've been getting into beekeeping lately.

175
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,419
Is something wrong with that?

176
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:43,712
What's wrong with that?

177
00:07:43,837 --> 00:07:45,881
Don't I have the right
to be happy? To exist?

178
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,549
I'm sorry I didn't 9/11

179
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,843
Pearl Harbor before breakfast,
but I have a life, too!

180
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,469
- I have dreams!
- And how's Summer?

181
00:07:51,553 --> 00:07:54,348
Did she have fun, too?

182
00:07:54,473 --> 00:07:56,266
Oh.
Uh-um.

183
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,018
Summer...
was...

184
00:07:58,143 --> 00:07:59,269
With us.

185
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:00,688
There.

186
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,940
You saw us take her in the car with us.

187
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:05,275
- Mm, yes.
- Yes, yes, of course.

188
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,568
Th-That's what happened.

189
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,529
- And now she's...
- Sleepy.

190
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,656
Um, she's... she's sleepy.

191
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,115
Really sleepy.
That's why she's not here.

192
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,242
So sleepy.

193
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,743
She's sleepy?!

194
00:08:14,868 --> 00:08:15,994
What the hell was that?!

195
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,728
I didn't see you trying anything!

196
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,289
Shitting the bed isn't better
than not shitting the bed!

197
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,958
Where's Summer?!

198
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,754
Geez.
Oh, man.

199
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:27,547
You know, maybe we went
too hardcore on these guys.

200
00:08:27,631 --> 00:08:28,798
Yeah, why do you think we never go back

201
00:08:28,882 --> 00:08:30,382
to a place we've already been?

202
00:08:30,467 --> 00:08:31,801
Do you know how many adventures
we could get out

203
00:08:31,885 --> 00:08:33,178
of Purge Planet, Morty?
Gear World?

204
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,846
I don't sequel.
It's called integrity.

205
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,264
Here, put this back on your face.

206
00:08:36,348 --> 00:08:38,642
- You kept it?
- Oh, did you want a new one?

207
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,021
- 'Sup?
- Yo.

208
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,772
Oh, shit.
It's them!

209
00:08:43,897 --> 00:08:45,899
The worst thing to ever happen to us!

210
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,317
Yeah, that makes sense.

211
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:48,568
Sorry, Morty, we tried pussin' it.

212
00:08:48,652 --> 00:08:50,154
Time to go in hot.

213
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,679
Rickputer, initiate
unnecessarily badass suit-up.

214
00:09:03,792 --> 00:09:05,210
Let's lick tits.

215
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,135
Shouldn't we be finding Summer?

216
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:16,388
Oh, right, gee, sorry.
I got caught up again.

217
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,223
God, d-do I need to take more Adderall,

218
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,267
or am I taking too much Adderall?

219
00:09:27,983 --> 00:09:30,194
Man, really shouldn't have gone
with swords.

220
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,987
I know.
My wrists are killing me.

221
00:09:32,112 --> 00:09:34,406
Flame-throwers next time, for sure.

222
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:36,033
Can I get a laser whip?

223
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:40,204
Okay, but there's no way
you don't chop your dick off.

224
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,664
Sum Sum, come with us if you want to live

225
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,917
at a lower standard than this, I guess.

226
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,335
God damn.

227
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,921
- Empress, is everything alright?
- Ummm

228
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,255
seize them!

229
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,590
- Seize them?!
- What?!

230
00:09:51,715 --> 00:09:54,015
- Summer, you bitch!
- You gotta be kidding me!

231
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:57,429
♪ Nobody knows the trouble
I've seen ♪

232
00:09:57,554 --> 00:09:58,847
You know that song, Rick?

233
00:09:58,972 --> 00:10:00,140
From the... When the prisoners sing it?

234
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:01,683
Come on, Morty, for fuck's sake.

235
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,267
It's my jail time.
I-I can spend it however I want.

236
00:10:06,438 --> 00:10:07,814
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy!
Hey, hey, hey!

237
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,108
Not in here!
Not in here!

238
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,235
Aw...
Gimme that.

239
00:10:13,153 --> 00:10:15,322
Leave us.

240
00:10:15,447 --> 00:10:17,047
What the fuck took you so long?!

241
00:10:17,157 --> 00:10:18,075
You left me here.

242
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,159
We didn't know you were with us!

243
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:20,952
Do you know how much shit
I've had to deal with?

244
00:10:21,036 --> 00:10:22,245
You're in a cape, Summer.

245
00:10:22,329 --> 00:10:23,330
How bad could it be?

246
00:10:23,455 --> 00:10:25,541
No bad story ends with a cape.

247
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,669
You don't know anything about my story.

248
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,921
<i>"I couldn't help but wonder,</i>

249
00:10:31,046 --> 00:10:34,299
<i>was Gharkhul really capable
of consuming a living sun,</i>

250
00:10:34,424 --> 00:10:37,136
<i>or was I simply getting
too close to Gharkhul?</i>

251
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,679
<i>Was Gharkhul consuming me?"</i>

252
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,221
Rick, can we listen to something else?

253
00:10:40,305 --> 00:10:41,848
Quiet! She's just about
to summon Gharkhul.

254
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,558
She's been talking about
summoning Gharkhul

255
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:44,992
for three episodes, Summer.

256
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,770
Wait a minute, what's that in your mouth?

257
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,105
It's a toothpick.

258
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,939
I'm a toothpicker now.
Get used to it.

259
00:10:50,023 --> 00:10:51,941
God, are you that desperate for a thing?

260
00:10:52,025 --> 00:10:53,735
It <i>is</i> my thing.

261
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:56,864
Just like yours is dying alone
and yours is jerking off.

262
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,700
At least jerking off tracks
for my character, you know?

263
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,119
I like to jerk off.
I'm 14. I own it.

264
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:03,703
- Well, I jerk off, too!
- Alright, stop.

265
00:11:03,787 --> 00:11:05,330
Jesus Chris, I don't wanna think
about that shit.

266
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:06,998
- Summer, keep your toothpick.
- Gross!

267
00:11:07,082 --> 00:11:08,541
Morty, stop talking to
your sister about jerking off.

268
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,675
Everyone pretend podcasting isn't boring.

269
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,215
Whoa, Morty, look how wet this egg is.

270
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,258
I dunno, Rick.
That looks a little too wet.

271
00:11:17,342 --> 00:11:18,676
- D-Don't touch it.
- Oh, I'm gonna touch it.

272
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,095
Why are you guys screaming at an egg?

273
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,429
Shut up, Summer!
Just let us look at an egg!

274
00:11:21,513 --> 00:11:22,806
Yeah, Summer, shut the fuck up.

275
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,390
- Fucking shit.
- Nobody wants you here.

276
00:11:24,474 --> 00:11:25,892
You know, sometimes we like
to go on adventures

277
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,227
- and look at wet eggs, you know?
- Can we just go?

278
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:28,436
This place is giving me the creeps.

279
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,729
Holy shit.
I love this egg.

280
00:11:29,813 --> 00:11:30,939
Hey, look, mine's doing it, too.

281
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,525
Are you guys sure that's safe?

282
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,569
Oh, my God!

283
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:41,074
All is Glorzo.

284
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:47,080
All is Glorzo.

285
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,083
- God.
- God.

286
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,211
God?
She has a toothpick.

287
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,254
Take it out and put her face in an egg.

288
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:55,797
- God.
- God.

289
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,674
For fuck's sake, how long
have you been hatched?

290
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:58,884
30 seconds?

291
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:01,178
I've been alive seven minutes.

292
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,638
- Think before you...
- Excuse me, seven minutes?

293
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,891
Uh, I've been here for 29 minutes.

294
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:08,059
But yes, take the toothpick
out of her mouth.

295
00:12:08,143 --> 00:12:11,313
Suck on her face this instant
and use her body to...

296
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:16,735
What was that?

297
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,946
That is called responsibility.

298
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,021
He was part of our greatest generation.

299
00:12:21,114 --> 00:12:24,159
He understood that what you need
to do is suck on a face,

300
00:12:24,284 --> 00:12:25,953
shit an egg, and die.

301
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,745
Wait, so, all you do is live
half an hour,

302
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:28,830
shit eggs, and die?

303
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,457
Yes.
We love it.

304
00:12:30,582 --> 00:12:31,917

- How is it going?
- Really good, commander.

331
00:13:59,504 --> 00:14:00,904
Should be ready by tomorrow.

332
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,215
That is what I like to hear.

333
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,301
Great work, Glory to Glorzo.

334
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:07,512
Honestly, Summer,
I can't thank you enough.

335
00:14:07,637 --> 00:14:10,140
When we met, we were just
shitting eggs in a cave,

336
00:14:10,265 --> 00:14:13,143
but you showed us life
is about more than that.

337
00:14:13,268 --> 00:14:14,686
It is about living.

338
00:14:14,811 --> 00:14:16,646
And now, with these missiles,

339
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:19,441
we will be able to reach
the entire universe.

340
00:14:19,566 --> 00:14:23,403
We say it all the time,
but I guess all is Glorzo.

341
00:14:23,528 --> 00:14:24,654
Yeah, that sounds great.

342
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,323
- And you've been great.
- Yeah.

343
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,366
You've been so great
that I've been thinking

344
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,744
maybe it's time for you
to get off my brother.

345
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:32,245
Who's your brother?

346
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,455
Oh, this?

347
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,915
Forgot he was there, haha.

348
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,583
Wait.
What are you saying?

349
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,459
I'm saying that you've been great, Steve,

350
00:14:38,543 --> 00:14:40,920
but we've been thinking
it's time for a new chapter.

351
00:14:41,004 --> 00:14:42,756
- We?
- Uh, this is Shane.

352
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:44,465
He'll be handling the day-to-day.

353
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:46,099
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

354
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:49,304
I might only be two minutes old,
but I know you're a legend.

355
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,397
She doesn't care about us.

356
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,475
She just wants her fuckin' host back.

357
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,893
- I don't know what to do.
- Oh, now you want my help.

358
00:14:55,977 --> 00:14:57,270
- Too late for that.
- Come on, man.

359
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:58,480
What is this shit?

360
00:14:58,605 --> 00:14:59,856
You don't get to do this to me.

361
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,233
We were in eggs together.

362
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:02,775
Oh, fuck since we were in eggs.

363
00:15:02,859 --> 00:15:04,027
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
now you respect, like,

364
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,779
the biological institutions now?

365
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:07,196
Fuck you.
All you care about

366
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,616
is "progress"
and society and skyscrapers.

367
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:11,409
You don't care about fuckin' biology.

368
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,286
Oh, yeah, well, what the fuck?

369
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,496
You... How you you haven't laid
and egg inside this old man yet?

370
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,082
Because I do what I want.

371
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,333
Because someone's gotta
stand up for what's right.

372
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,625
Why do you hate her so much?

373
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:23,171
Because she took you away from me!

374
00:15:23,296 --> 00:15:25,006
Whoa, man.
Jesus Christ.

375
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,551
- No, I-I didn't, I...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. No.

376
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,928
It's cool.

377
00:15:30,053 --> 00:15:31,805
I feel the same way.

378
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:38,228
Oh, my God, I...

379
00:15:38,353 --> 00:15:39,896
I wish we could suck on each other.

380
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,523
- I wanna suck on you, too.
- I'm gonna suck you so hard.

381
00:15:42,607 --> 00:15:44,192
- Suck me.
- C-C-Can we do this?

382
00:15:44,317 --> 00:15:45,651
A-A-Are we allowed to do this?

383
00:15:45,735 --> 00:15:47,404
I don't care.
I just want you.

384
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:48,697
Fuck all of this.

385
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,073
Let's just get the hell outta here

386
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,033
and be whatever the fuck we want.

387
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,578
That's evolution.
That's progress.

388
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,164
I want a family.
Can we have a family.

389
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,999
Yeah.

390
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,508
Aah, aah!

391
00:16:14,931 --> 00:16:16,016
Oh, my God.

392
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,893
Holy shit.
Oh.

393
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,143
What are... What are these things?!

394
00:16:19,227 --> 00:16:20,228
Do I look like I know?

395
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,397
Hey, wait a second.
How'd you know that last part?

396
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,357
You weren't there for that.
I had to fill in some gaps.

397
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:26,609
Everyone around the office
knew about Steve and Bruce.

398
00:16:26,693 --> 00:16:30,405
I've got a plan, okay.
You just have to follow my lead.

399
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,824
The punishment is

400
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:34,325
- death.
- Motherfucker. Summer!

401
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:36,209
- You said you had a plan!
- Silence.

402
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,455
The council of Glorzos has spoken.

403
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,872
More like council of shit.

404
00:16:39,956 --> 00:16:41,958
- Glorzo is law.
- Silence.

405
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,794
The punishment is death.

406
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,297
By...
getting into their car.

407
00:16:47,422 --> 00:16:48,924
- Summer?
- Shut up.

408
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,760
Yes, place them in the car.

409
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:53,053
Those pieces of shit.

410
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,804
No, no, no!
This is like torture.

411
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,890
No, I-I-I-I hate being in my car.

412
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:59,518
You deserve it, you pieces of shit.

413
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,561
And to make sure the sentence is passed,

414
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,396
I shall be joining them.

415
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,856
In the car.

416
00:17:04,981 --> 00:17:07,817
And we shall drive away
from here and die.

417
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,319
Oooookay.

418
00:17:09,444 --> 00:17:10,946
Guess what, everybody.

419
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,698
It's me, the whiny guy
you never want to hear from.

420
00:17:13,823 --> 00:17:15,773
She's trying to escape with her family.

421
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:16,910
My time to shine.

422
00:17:17,035 --> 00:17:18,453
Execute her.

423
00:17:18,578 --> 00:17:21,122
Okay, plan B.
Morty, now.

424
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,668
Aah!

425
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,419
Jesus, Morty, that sucks.

426
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,712
Alright, stop playing, Morty.

427
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,130
I-I got this.

428
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:31,841
Aah!

429
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:39,182
This is what we get for evolving?

430
00:17:39,307 --> 00:17:41,351
Sorry!
Sorry.

431
00:17:41,476 --> 00:17:43,561
I-I'm sorry. We... We...
We thought you were evil.

432
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,230
Why would you think that?

433
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:48,191
We had a giant tower
that blared "Glorzo is peace."

434
00:17:48,316 --> 00:17:49,775
I know.
I... Should... Should we help?

435
00:17:49,859 --> 00:17:50,819
Boo!

436
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,111
Oh, like that's helping.

437
00:17:52,195 --> 00:17:53,946
Got it. Going.
Okay, we're gonna hit the road.

438
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:57,075
- You're... You're just going?
- You told us to go!

439
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,286
Once again, I'm so sorry for what they...

440
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,828
You're part of this, too.
Boo!

441
00:18:00,912 --> 00:18:02,038
We hate you the most.

442
00:18:02,163 --> 00:18:04,332
Get out.

443
00:18:04,457 --> 00:18:06,000
Jesus, Summer, why'd you let these things

444
00:18:06,084 --> 00:18:07,234
stay on us for so long?

445
00:18:07,335 --> 00:18:08,795
I was working with a lot.

446
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,423
Just let me listen
to the podcast next time.

447
00:18:15,885 --> 00:18:17,429
Nailed that landing.

448
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,683
Huh.
Neat-looking egg.

449
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,315
Okay, well, I'm not
cleaning up this shit.

450
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,985
Aah!

451
00:18:36,489 --> 00:18:39,033
Maybe we, uh... Maybe we don't
tell people about this one.

452
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:40,535
Did we at least learn something?

453
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,746
That we suck and everyone sucks?

454
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,498
I guess that counts.

455
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:46,791
Later, chodes.

456
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,543
Hit me on the next one.

457
00:18:51,504 --> 00:18:52,922
You know, Rick, I'm sure you wanna jump

458
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:55,466
into another crazy adventure,
but can we just relax

459
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,260
and maybe watch
some interdimensional cable?

460
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,303
- I'm cool if you are.
- Honestly, that sounds great.

461
00:18:59,387 --> 00:19:01,180
W-We don't need to try so hard, you know.

462
00:19:01,264 --> 00:19:02,974
Let's just take it easy
and riff, you know.

463
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,142
- That's what I love about us.
- Me, too, buddy.

464
00:19:05,226 --> 00:19:07,020
<i>Do you suffer from Alzheimer's?</i>

465
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:08,772
<i>Do you suffer from Alzheimer's?</i>

466
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,189
<i>Do you suffer from Alzheimer's?</i>

467
00:19:10,273 --> 00:19:11,816
<i>Do you suffer from Alzheimer's?</i>

468
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,984
<i>Reggie?</i>

469
00:19:13,109 --> 00:19:14,193
<i>Do you suffer</i> from Alzheimer's?

470
00:19:14,277 --> 00:19:15,444
<i>Reggie, you alright in there?</i>

471
00:19:15,528 --> 00:19:17,489
Mm, Rick, do you feel...

472
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,949
Oh, God, I have to shit an egg.

473
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,201
Oh, my God, oh, shit.

474
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,577
Oh, it hurts.
Oh God,

475
00:19:22,702 --> 00:19:24,328
is this how we die, Rick?
Is this how we die?!

476
00:19:24,412 --> 00:19:25,788
I don't know, Morty.
I don't know! Aah!

477
00:19:25,872 --> 00:19:27,081
I don't want to shit an egg, Rick!

478
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:28,374
I'm sorry, Morty. I'm sorry!

479
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,750
It's my fault.
It's all my fault!

480
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:31,002
Hey, you two. Did you...

481
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:33,421
Beth, your son is dying!
Say goodbye!

482
00:19:33,546 --> 00:19:35,423
- What are you...
- Say goodbye to your little boy!

483
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,841
No, look away!

484
00:19:36,966 --> 00:19:39,016
I'm making an egg, Mom.
I'm making an egg!

485
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,585
You said you'd keep me more
in the loop this year.

486
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,973
Look away, Beth!
Daddy loves you!

487
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,266
My ass!
My ass!

488
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:46,518
This is it, Morty!

489
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,227
It's full circle from the pilot.

490
00:19:48,311 --> 00:19:49,479
Full circle!

491
00:19:55,026 --> 00:19:56,653
Oh, I guess we, uh...

492
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:57,945
I guess we both just had to take a shit.

493
00:19:58,029 --> 00:19:59,572
Yeah, I-I-I guess we, uh...

494
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,865
Fucking gross.

495
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,909
Guys, clean it up.

496
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:37,235
Look at your dad.

497
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,655
Such a dork, keeping bees.

498
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,032
I mean, it's... at least
it's interesting, though.

499
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:45,410
At least, like...
I wish my dad kept bees.

500
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,120
I mean, it's kind of cute.

501
00:20:48,204 --> 00:20:52,959
Like...
your dad keeps bees.

502
00:20:53,084 --> 00:20:55,503
How old is your dad?

503
00:20:55,628 --> 00:20:59,674
He's obviously beekeeping age.

504
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:02,594
I don't know, I think it's kind of sweet.

505
00:21:05,054 --> 00:21:06,555
Summer, I want to fuck your dad.

506
00:21:06,639 --> 00:21:07,891
Oh, really?
