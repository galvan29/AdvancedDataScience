1
00:00:04,837 --> 00:00:06,756
Get us out of here.
I'll hold them off.

2
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:12,762
My name is Beth Smith.

3
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:14,972
Tell your top bugs the Defiance lives on.

4
00:00:15,097 --> 00:00:16,265
I will.
I will.

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,100
I'll make you a legend.
Blade Smith.

6
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:19,018
Beth Smith.

7
00:00:19,143 --> 00:00:20,269
Beth. Beth.
Beth Smith.

8
00:00:20,394 --> 00:00:22,313
Okay. God.
It's just such a plain...

9
00:00:22,438 --> 00:00:24,273
I'm trying to come up
with a mnemonic device.

10
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:26,024
You could connect it to not dying.

11
00:00:26,108 --> 00:00:26,817
I know, I know!

12
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:28,277
You'd think that would sear it right in,

13
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,362
but it just speaks
to the sheer forgettability.

14
00:00:30,446 --> 00:00:33,241
Oh, God.
I-I am so sorry, um...

15
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,952
Uh... Oh, God.
Starts with a...

16
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,536
<i>Congratulations
to your government, business,</i>

17
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,288
<i>or terror cell on its acquisition</i>

18
00:00:39,413 --> 00:00:41,290
<i>of the NX-5 Planet Remover by Xamazax</i>

19
00:00:41,415 --> 00:00:43,165
<i>in partnership with Wrangler jeans.</i>

20
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:46,337
<i>The NX-5's industry-leading
tachyon beams eliminate planets</i>

21
00:00:46,462 --> 00:00:47,797
<i>twice as fast as the NX-4S</i>

22
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:50,549
<i>with half the battery and zero

23
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:52,176
<i>That's right.
No more secret hole</i>

24
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,760
<i>that blows the whole thing up

25
00:00:53,844 --> 00:00:54,887
<i>Your enemies will say it's unfair.</i>

26
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,514
<i>We say it's about time.</i>

27
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,390
Damn it.
We risked our lives for that?

28
00:00:58,474 --> 00:01:00,392
You did your best.
Maybe you need a break.

29
00:01:00,476 --> 00:01:02,227
- Don't you ever miss Earth?
- I don't have to miss it.

30
00:01:02,311 --> 00:01:03,729
I'm technically still there.

31
00:01:03,854 --> 00:01:06,691
My dad made a perfect clone
of me to take my place.

32
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,817
Boy, that Rick.

33
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:10,736
So, if you do go back,
what happens to the clone?

34
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:11,778
Does it have, like,

35
00:01:11,862 --> 00:01:13,912
a proximity-triggered device in its neck?

36
00:01:14,031 --> 00:01:15,631
- Who cares? Are we done?
- Sure.

37
00:01:15,741 --> 00:01:17,034
Unless you want me to remove

38
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,204
the proximity-triggered device
from your neck.

39
00:01:20,329 --> 00:01:21,664
Think it's a bomb?

40
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:23,415
Man, what if this is how you found out

41
00:01:23,499 --> 00:01:25,001
he never wanted you back,

42
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:27,420
that he loved the clone more than you?

43
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:28,879
How crazy would that be?

44
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:31,465
Crazy and of... of course
soul-crushing. For you.

45
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:32,841
I actually have something for that.

46
00:01:32,925 --> 00:01:34,468
Y-You want some?
They're nonaddictive.

47
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,470
That's not true.
They're totally addictive.

48
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:37,680
I'm a terrible doctor.

49
00:01:37,805 --> 00:01:39,181
I actually have something for that, too.

50
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,100
You want some?
Nonaddictive.

51
00:01:41,225 --> 00:01:43,394
Mmm!
I'm a great doctor.

52
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:16,969
Dr. Wong had a cancellation
today.

53
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:18,387
Anybody up for a family session?

54
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,721
- I could do that.
- I'm... I'm down to clown.

55
00:02:19,805 --> 00:02:21,557
Not sure my therapy puppet
will be done in time.

56
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,141
Great, because she specifically asked you

57
00:02:23,225 --> 00:02:24,977
to stop bringing puppets.
Dad?

58
00:02:25,102 --> 00:02:27,271
I love therapy...
Family therapy most of all...

59
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:30,900
But I am actually disintegrating.

60
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,067
- Oh, my God!
- Whoa! Dad!

61
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:33,861
Is that really it?
We did it?

62
00:02:33,986 --> 00:02:35,336
It's the invisibility belt.

63
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:37,698
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

64
00:02:37,823 --> 00:02:38,699
He grazed them.

65
00:02:38,824 --> 00:02:40,075
That's gonna hurt in like 10 seconds.

66
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:42,077
- Thanks, Morty.
- Why should I let you use it?

67
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:43,787
- You never let me use it.
- Can I have the belt?

68
00:02:43,871 --> 00:02:45,831
- It would really piss off Morty.
- Fantastic idea.

69
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,875
What the hell?!
You jerk! Give it!

70
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,420
- Hey! Ow!
- Share the invisibility.

71
00:02:51,545 --> 00:02:52,129
- Jerry?
- Ooh.

72
00:02:52,254 --> 00:02:53,338
This looks like a job
for Mr. Nibbles.

73
00:02:53,422 --> 00:02:54,798
Let me just glue one more eye on.

74
00:02:54,882 --> 00:02:56,884
I'm gonna kill you!

75
00:02:57,009 --> 00:02:58,343
Oof.
Looks like you two have to fight

76
00:02:58,427 --> 00:02:59,886
about why you can't control your kids.

77
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,430
Good thing Dr. Wong's
got an opening.

78
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,224
Bye.

79
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,851
- You're a bad father.
- Don't let him divide us!

80
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:09,230
Garage, family therapy mode.

81
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,065
Ah.

82
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:15,403
Honey!
You're back.

83
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,654
You seem surprised.

84
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:19,365
- You never wrote.
- And never exploded?

85
00:03:20,032 --> 00:03:23,035
What I'm hearing is
that you think that's a bomb.

86
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,580
So does every engineer that's seen it.

87
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,707
Engineer?
Princess, I'm sure every caveman

88
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,792
that sees a microwave calls
it a rock cabinet.

89
00:03:30,876 --> 00:03:34,255
The point of inventing is
to make things that don't exist.

90
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:40,302
Then whip me up a reason not to kill you.

91
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,388
Dad, we're off to Dr. Wong's.

92
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:44,557
Scan <i>her.</i>

93
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,392
Dad?

94
00:03:47,309 --> 00:03:48,769
Okay. Have fun, pumpkin.

95
00:03:48,894 --> 00:03:50,520
Sorry I'm a piece-of-shit father.

96
00:03:50,604 --> 00:03:53,441
Oh! Well, the
self-loathing buys a lot back.

97
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:54,650
Jerry, leave the puppet.

98
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,986
It's a one-way ticket
to a breakthrough, Beth.

99
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:59,311
The device in her neck
<i>would</i> have transferred

100
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,031
a database of her memories to your device

101
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,199
before vaporizing her.

102
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,617
So much for that plan.

103
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,412
Why is she... it...
Why am I back with Jerry?

104
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:08,164
I thought she was a copy of me.

105
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,289
She <i>is</i> a copy of you.

106
00:04:09,373 --> 00:04:12,418
If she ran back to that
dingleberry, that's on you.

107
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:13,919
- Want to grab a drink?
- All the time.

108
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:14,962
Good girl.

109
00:04:17,923 --> 00:04:19,258
Ooh.

110
00:04:33,063 --> 00:04:34,940
- To catch a predator.
- What the hell?!

111
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:37,485
Thermal goggles, bitch.
Mom said share!

112
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,810
You can't share invisibility.
Take those off.

113
00:04:42,114 --> 00:04:43,824
No!

114
00:04:46,118 --> 00:04:48,036
So I'll just see you
at cheerleader practice?

115
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,164
Should I bring a poncho?

116
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:51,957
All right!
State your terms.

117
00:04:52,082 --> 00:04:54,168
Give back the belt.
You take the goggles.

118
00:04:54,293 --> 00:04:56,420
Go away.
We trade in an hour.

119
00:04:56,545 --> 00:04:58,214
Deal.

120
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,466
How do you like that, bitch?

121
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,676
I liked it more than my old belt.

122
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,261
"Tiny Big Man Junior"?

123
00:05:04,386 --> 00:05:06,722
You should've shared.

124
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,898
What are you doing in my house?

125
00:05:09,016 --> 00:05:11,268
Did I wander that far from my console?

126
00:05:11,393 --> 00:05:14,230
They should put a warning
on these things.

127
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,773
So, we overrode the gates,

128
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:18,025
and the slave rebellion took the capital.

129
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,652
- Pretty cool.
- Very cool.

130
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:22,530
My daughter, having space adventures.

131
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,658
They are skewing
a tad Star Wars-y, though.

132
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:26,908
Don't forget to have fun.

133
00:05:26,992 --> 00:05:28,910
Well, I came back to murder you,
not get your notes,

134
00:05:28,994 --> 00:05:31,329
but I'll remember to fart more
while I'm saving the galaxy.

135
00:05:31,413 --> 00:05:33,248
Okay. I'm the one
that made this possible.

136
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:35,000
- It's not a competition.
- Of course not.

137
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,084
Just curious, though...

138
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:38,468
If it were, would "most wanted"
be first place?

139
00:05:40,756 --> 00:05:42,299
You're fighting the Gromflomites?

140
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,050
Dad, they're trying to take over
the galaxy!

141
00:05:44,134 --> 00:05:46,344
Everybody in the galaxy
tries to take over the galaxy.

142
00:05:46,428 --> 00:05:48,931
The trick is to be left alone
by whoever succeeds.

143
00:05:49,056 --> 00:05:50,641
Ah, it's your hero phase.

144
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:52,518
I had one, too.
You'll outgrow it.

145
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:53,561
No, <i>you</i> did.

146
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,103
I'm not gonna outgrow giving a shit.

147
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:57,272
<i>Sources tell us these aliens,
who call themselves</i>

148
00:05:57,356 --> 00:06:00,442
<i>the New Galactic Federation,
will blow up the planet</i>

149
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,861
<i>unless some woman with a very
boring name gives herself up.</i>

150
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,154
- Oh, come on.
- Way to give a shit.

151
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,989
Next time, don't wipe it
on your home planet.

152
00:06:06,073 --> 00:06:07,866
Oh, shit.
They're gonna track down Beth.

153
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,702
You mean Beth's clone.

154
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:12,288
Right.
Beth's clone.

155
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:14,164
What... What did I say?

156
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,045
It really was nice seeing you again.

157
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,589
Whoo!

158
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,757
Yeah! Go, Honey Bees!

159
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,467
Good practice, girls!

160
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,177
And remember, we are in a drought,

161
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:30,389
so be sure to shower as one big
group at the exact same time.

162
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,142
Shower fire!
The shower's on fire!

163
00:06:34,226 --> 00:06:35,676
Step aside, girls!
I got this!

164
00:06:42,234 --> 00:06:43,527
You're a monster!

165
00:06:43,652 --> 00:06:45,613
Still want to share?

166
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,494
<i>Morty Smith, hands up.</i>

167
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,039
<i>You are under arrest for crimes against</i>

168
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,291
<i>the New Improved Galactic Federation.</i>

169
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,042
<i>Wait. What?
How are you doing that?</i>

170
00:06:59,126 --> 00:07:01,419
<i>You're not psychic, are you?
Do you have psychic powers?</i>

171
00:07:01,503 --> 00:07:02,880
Uh, yes.

172
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,005
<i>Are they strong powers?</i>

173
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:05,549
<i>We're just looking for your mother.</i>

174
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,592
<i>You can't, like,
stop our hearts, can you?</i>

175
00:07:07,676 --> 00:07:08,719
Uh, I can.

176
00:07:08,844 --> 00:07:09,970
<i>Okay.
We surrender.</i>

177
00:07:10,095 --> 00:07:12,180
Jerry, do you agree
that the use of puppets

178
00:07:12,264 --> 00:07:14,058
makes you seem dumb and crazy?

179
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,476
I don't think "crazy"

180
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,561
is a responsible word to use in...

181
00:07:17,686 --> 00:07:20,064
It is now. This is crazy.
You're being crazy.

182
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:21,649
They do it in therapy on TV.

183
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,474
Well, TV gives British people
prizes for baking, Jerry.

184
00:07:29,698 --> 00:07:31,492
- Tammy?
- Tonya? Tammya. Tammya.

185
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,701
Hi, Mrs. Smith.

186
00:07:32,826 --> 00:07:34,244
I like your hair better this way.

187
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,662
- How's the stomach?
- What?

188
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:36,997
Hey!

189
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:38,666
I only said "hey"!

190
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,834
It's not like I can do more than that.

191
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,377
As much as I'd like to kill you,

192
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:44,880
my superiors have some questions
about the Defiance.

193
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:48,425
I don't have a... I have a Defiance?

194
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,177
Oh, God.
I'm a clone.

195
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:51,595
That's your defense?

196
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,347
No.
My defense is eat me.

197
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:54,473
- Ow!
- Hey! Aah!

198
00:07:54,598 --> 00:07:59,561
We've been over this!
All I do is say "hey"!

199
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,522
Smart guns, wait-list human life.

200
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:02,982
And the therapist.

201
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:10,655
Tammy, this is the office

202
00:08:10,739 --> 00:08:12,407
where my family works to better itself.

203
00:08:12,491 --> 00:08:13,575
What, and that makes it sacred?

204
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,243
No, it makes it a place
I've rigged with a lot

205
00:08:15,327 --> 00:08:17,245
of voice-activated escape contingencies.

206
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:18,872
These are all good points.

207
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,848
I need to take a long look at myself.

208
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:26,755
- I'd like to discuss that.
- I don't discuss problems.

209
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,757
I incinerate 'em.
Everybody in the car.

210
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,011
Everybody in my family, not the world.

211
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,929
Jesus, Wong.
Boundaries.

212
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:38,267
I'm better than this job.

213
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,355
Can't you just make a portal?

214
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,106
Your children are down
there invisible, Jerry.

215
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,108
"Make a portal"?
Father of the year back here.

216
00:08:47,192 --> 00:08:49,695
You're one to talk.
You told me I wasn't a clone.

217
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,447
Y-You're not a clone.

218
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:52,698
And who is that?

219
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,450
Uh... Uh, a clone.

220
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,455
Why would you make a clone of me

221
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:01,998
just to send the clone into space?

222
00:09:02,082 --> 00:09:03,750
Well, you didn't want to go,
and I thought,

223
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:04,918
"Okay, that's cool."

224
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,170
But then I thought, "Well, you
know what would be even cooler,

225
00:09:07,254 --> 00:09:09,214
is a space daughter," s-so I made one.

226
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:11,299
And I put a bomb in her neck
in case she ever came back.

227
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:12,300
Father of the year!

228
00:09:12,384 --> 00:09:13,677
She wasn't supposed to come back!

229
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:14,386
Why did she?

230
00:09:14,511 --> 00:09:15,762
Well, she found a bomb in her neck.

231
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,389
Wouldn't you?

232
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,017
- Father of the year.
- Shut up!

233
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:22,477
I'm tired of believing you.
I want to talk to her.

234
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:24,437
- No, you don't.
- Jerry, do something!

235
00:09:24,521 --> 00:09:25,354
Hey.

236
00:09:30,235 --> 00:09:32,071
He told me you're the clone.

237
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:34,614
- What do you think he told me?
- You're the clone?

238
00:09:34,698 --> 00:09:36,325
Wow.
Naive <i>and</i> attractive.

239
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,077
Wow.
Jaded <i>and</i> hot.

240
00:09:39,369 --> 00:09:41,246
I know this is bad parenting,

241
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:42,956
but if you stop fighting,
you both get McDonald's.

242
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,959
How about I just blow my brains
out, starting with hers?

243
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,377
Okay, Wendy's.
We love Wendy's.

244
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:48,962
I-I think they even gave us some money.

245
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,922
- Drop it. Don't move!
- Freeze! Get down!

246
00:09:51,006 --> 00:09:52,591
Everybody, shut up!

247
00:09:52,716 --> 00:09:54,468
You're all saying different shit!

248
00:09:54,593 --> 00:09:56,136
Wait.
So there <i>are</i> two of them?

249
00:09:56,261 --> 00:09:58,806
More importantly, which one is mine?

250
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,432
Uh, neither, chauvinist.

251
00:10:00,557 --> 00:10:02,476
Whatever.
Take them both.

252
00:10:06,021 --> 00:10:08,273
Cool beam.
But let's bargain.

253
00:10:08,398 --> 00:10:10,275
- I'm the one you really want.
- Excuse me?

254
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,901
Uh, smartest man in the universe?

255
00:10:11,985 --> 00:10:13,685
Secret to interdimensional travel?

256
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,864
- Ask your bosses.
- My bosses are bugs, Rick.

257
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,366
You killed the old ones.
The new ones are half my age.

258
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:22,037
They know if you're left alone,
you're a non-threat.

259
00:10:22,162 --> 00:10:23,831
- Oof-a!
- We got the payload.

260
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,707
Fire up the NX-5.

261
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:26,791
Earth's going ta-ta.

262
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,252
You might want to do that thing
where you find a new universe

263
00:10:29,336 --> 00:10:30,920
where you can suck yourself off.

264
00:10:31,004 --> 00:10:32,630
- You can't tell me what to do.
- Awesome.

265
00:10:32,714 --> 00:10:34,383
He resisted.
We can shoot him.

266
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,343
- Wha...
- Just go with it, Jerry.

267
00:10:36,468 --> 00:10:38,804
Everybody, drop your guns...
Except for Jerry!

268
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:41,390
Fucking classic.

269
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,436
- Holy shit! Morty!
- And Summer!

270
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,521
W-We worked together!
That's... That's our arc!

271
00:10:48,605 --> 00:10:51,107
We went from siblings to
invisible to working together.

272
00:10:51,191 --> 00:10:52,901
It's not "Citizen Kane," but why compete

273
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,154
with whatever's going on here, you know?

274
00:10:57,739 --> 00:10:59,575
Aah!

275
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:02,619
You made me go to a wedding.

276
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:06,414
And you killed my best friend.
I should've said that one first.

277
00:11:06,498 --> 00:11:11,378
<i>Congratulations, Earth,
on being destroyed by the NX-5,</i>

278
00:11:11,503 --> 00:11:14,631
<i>brought to you by Wrangler.</i>

279
00:11:18,343 --> 00:11:20,193
Guess the galaxy's most-wanted mammal

280
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:22,222
needs her daddy
to come change her diapie.

281
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,182
Come on, kids.

282
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:26,852
We have to go do a fucking
piece-of-shit "Star Wars."

283
00:11:29,813 --> 00:11:31,607
<i>Attention, Zeta 99-2.</i>

284
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,859
We know you have a stolen ship.
Stand down.

285
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,737
Oh, am I not a non-threat now?

286
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,079
Hey, you are not cleared to land!

287
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,415
- We will open fire!
- Hold your ground, men!

288
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,541
You'll be heroes!

289
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,170
Summer, try unlocking that door

290
00:11:54,254 --> 00:11:56,047
by scanning your high-school
friend's dead face.

291
00:11:56,131 --> 00:11:57,591
Uh, I have... I have to pee.

292
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:59,175
Pee on the floor.
It's a Death Star.

293
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:01,511
Okay. But there's rebellion
and then there's...

294
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,263
- Here, Dad.
- Perfect.

295
00:12:03,388 --> 00:12:06,099
What am I doing wrong?

296
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,433
Ugh. Her eyes are closed.

297
00:12:07,517 --> 00:12:10,270
Morty, open the left one.
I've got the right.

298
00:12:11,104 --> 00:12:12,814
She died the way she lived...
Overserialized.

299
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,607
I'm gonna rescue your mom and her clone

300
00:12:14,691 --> 00:12:15,859
without revealing which is which.

301
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,694
You two find the NX-5 and shut it down.

302
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,362
I mean, don't die trying.
There's infinite Earths.

303
00:12:19,446 --> 00:12:21,156
If you can save this one, it's gravy.

304
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,532
Dream team rides again!

305
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:24,117
Oh, yeah.
We're like Luke and Leia.

306
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,577
Uh, except no kissing part.

307
00:12:25,702 --> 00:12:27,036
What's another famous
brother-sister team?

308
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,037
Uh, Hansel and Gretel?

309
00:12:28,121 --> 00:12:29,664
Yeah, right.
Those two were fucking.

310
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:30,832
Dad, we need the belt.

311
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,167
I can't go with you guys watching.

312
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,377
- You're invisible!
- What if the pee isn't?

313
00:12:34,461 --> 00:12:36,630
You know what?
We don't need invisibility.

314
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:38,382
Working together is our belt.

315
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:39,674
That's our arc.
Let's do it.

316
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:42,458
I'm gonna go ahead and whistle.
That's how good I feel.

317
00:12:47,474 --> 00:12:49,768
Oh, God. I knew it.

318
00:12:51,603 --> 00:12:54,147
Ugh.
This floor isn't level.

319
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,192
Are they gonna torture us?

320
00:12:57,317 --> 00:12:59,152
Unless you plan on telling them
what I know.

321
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,238
Last chance to guess who was the clone.

322
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:02,447
You're his daughter.

323
00:13:02,572 --> 00:13:03,824
Something about the eyes,

324
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,618
the shameless abandonment of your family.

325
00:13:06,743 --> 00:13:08,453
How ever can I live with myself?

326
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:11,289
One theory... I was designed by
your father to live with myself,

327
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:12,999
which would mean you made
a conscious choice

328
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,501
to swallow your dreams with
cheap wine and dinosaur pasta.

329
00:13:15,585 --> 00:13:17,045
You know that's the kind Jerry likes,

330
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,255
same way I know the only
goddamn dream you'll ever follow

331
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:20,715
is your shitty father's approval.

332
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,717
You fetch your shitty father's lemonade.

333
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:24,719
You cosplay as your
shitty father in his 30s.

334
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,096
<i>Red alert. Red alert.</i>

335
00:13:26,221 --> 00:13:28,265
<i>Rick Sanchez...</i>

336
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,433
<i>More like</i> dead <i>alert.
What else? What else?</i>

337
00:13:30,517 --> 00:13:31,768
<i>I wrote some stuff down in my Notes app.</i>

338
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,937
<i>Let me just find it.</i>

339
00:13:34,062 --> 00:13:36,562
<i>Screw it. Beth, if...
If one of you is still alive,</i>

340
00:13:36,648 --> 00:13:37,649
<i>you're my real daughter.</i>

341
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,567
<i>If you're both alive,
don't hurt the other one.</i>

342
00:13:39,651 --> 00:13:41,319
<i>She's just a clone.
She's not worth it.</i>

343
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:42,362
<i>I'm coming, baby!</i>

344
00:13:42,487 --> 00:13:44,698
- That piece of shit.
- What a piece of shit.

345
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,533
I came back to kill him, you know.

346
00:13:46,658 --> 00:13:47,701
I'd like to help.

347
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:49,828
- Kick me between my eyes.
- From here?

348
00:13:49,953 --> 00:13:50,912
Oh, you dropped yoga

349
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,346
so you could buy Jerry
more Flintstones Vitam...

350
00:13:57,377 --> 00:14:00,422
Oh, I do not like the looks
of this giant fight chamber.

351
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:07,971
Bird Person?

352
00:14:08,096 --> 00:14:09,639
It is now Phoenix Person.

353
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:12,601
You're working for them?
What did they do to you, B.P.?

354
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:15,062
It is now P.P.
Where is Tammy?

355
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,564
Oh, don't worry about her.
I killed her.

356
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:19,066
I loved her.

357
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:19,900
Really?
Huh.

358
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,734
Then can I suggest as an alternate name

359
00:14:21,818 --> 00:14:23,320
Crazy Pussy-Whipped Person?

360
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:31,745
Aah!

361
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,045
It's funny. I always wondered
who would win if we ever fought.

362
00:14:41,129 --> 00:14:43,256
Then you were always a bad friend.

363
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,223
Aah!

364
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,808
Morty, we had one grenade.

365
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,893
- He had a gun.
- Whatever. Come on.

366
00:14:56,269 --> 00:14:57,895
- Did you hear something?
- Doesn't matter.

367
00:14:57,979 --> 00:14:59,981
If anyone's around,
they're here to stop the laser,

368
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,649
and they can't do it
without us seeing them.

369
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:03,109
"Working together is our belt"?

370
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:05,236
- You gave it away!
- You said we didn't need it.

371
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,220
- I wish you were never born.
- Well, you were an accident!

372
00:15:09,282 --> 00:15:10,533
How come some of the pants are...

373
00:15:10,617 --> 00:15:12,869
The NX-5 can't destroy Wrangler jeans.

374
00:15:12,994 --> 00:15:16,122
Like, it literally can't destroy
them or it's programmed not to?

375
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:18,333
Gee, what do <i>you</i> think?

376
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,772
Aah!

377
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,820
- Aah!
- Oh!

378
00:15:50,615 --> 00:15:52,367
You kill a good bug for a horse doctor.

379
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,660
Thanks, me.

380
00:15:53,785 --> 00:15:55,411
Maybe we could do, like,
a "Parent Trap" thing

381
00:15:55,495 --> 00:15:56,395
together sometime.

382
00:15:56,496 --> 00:15:58,164
As long as you mean
the Lindsay Lohan version.

383
00:15:58,248 --> 00:15:59,166
Naturally.

384
00:16:01,626 --> 00:16:03,586
What do you think they do
with all those jeans?

385
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,587
Make them into jackets?

386
00:16:04,671 --> 00:16:06,714
It's not about conserving denim.
It's marketing.

387
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:08,758
Like, uh, "The NX-5 destroys
the whole planet

388
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,469
except for the Wrangler jeans."

389
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:13,054
'Cause they're so tough.
Tougher than the laser?

390
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,889
- Stupid.
- You're talking about it.

391
00:16:14,973 --> 00:16:16,557
You're right.
They... They got me.

392
00:16:16,641 --> 00:16:17,934
Hey, over here!
Look at me!

393
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,894
Did you just see a pantsless
little boy run by?

394
00:16:19,978 --> 00:16:21,312
I'm not falling for that again.

395
00:16:21,396 --> 00:16:23,189
I used to be invisible,
but now I'm the opposite!

396
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,357
Get him!
But not in a weird way.

397
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,650
You made it weird.

398
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:34,034
<i>NX-5 corporate sponsor detected.</i>

399
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,912
<i>Cannot penetrate Wranglers!
Built too tough!</i>

400
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,664
<i>Built... too... tough.</i>

401
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,000
I killed them!
I-I did... I did it offscreen!

402
00:16:43,084 --> 00:16:44,752
God damn it, Morty.
Fix your underwear.

403
00:16:44,836 --> 00:16:47,213
- I saw your balls for a second.
- That's on you.

404
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,841
Why can't I meet your parents?
Are you embarrassed of me?

405
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,092
No.
Of them.

406
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,093
Aww.

407
00:17:00,143 --> 00:17:01,228
Aah!

408
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:06,566
Aah!

409
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,779
Never thought this was how I'd die.

410
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,113
We're nowhere near Venice,

411
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,047
and you're not a dwarf in a raincoat.

412
00:17:17,577 --> 00:17:18,578
Step back.

413
00:17:18,703 --> 00:17:21,497
You're not killing him till we
kick his ass, Bird Person.

414
00:17:21,581 --> 00:17:23,542
My name is Phoenix Person.

415
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,042
No one's calling you that.
Dumb.

416
00:17:25,126 --> 00:17:26,961
It fascinates me that an entire family

417
00:17:27,045 --> 00:17:30,215
can be this critical and suck this much.

418
00:17:42,435 --> 00:17:44,145
Aah!

419
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,981
Bird Person, stop.

420
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,400
It's me, that Tammy girl.

421
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,777
Tammy, this is unexpected.

422
00:17:50,902 --> 00:17:52,320
I was told you were dead.

423
00:17:52,445 --> 00:17:55,115
That is <i>absolutely</i> not true.

424
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,326
I'm more alive than I've ever been!

425
00:17:58,451 --> 00:18:00,620
You are behaving rather strangely.

426
00:18:00,745 --> 00:18:02,747
Me? Strange?
Oh, my!

427
00:18:02,872 --> 00:18:04,624
Well, who's normal, really?

428
00:18:04,749 --> 00:18:07,252
Now, come here, you big
hollow-boned featherhead.

429
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,504
Let me give you some of this sweet ass.

430
00:18:09,629 --> 00:18:12,007
Aah!

431
00:18:18,763 --> 00:18:21,891
Saved the day with puppeting.
Only one with a decent arc.

432
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,226
He does have his moments.

433
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,395
Mom, Dad... Mom.

434
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,647
Uh, we did it!
Morty became super visible!

435
00:18:27,772 --> 00:18:30,025
Summer put my jeans in a laser!

436
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,027
Morty, look at your little balls!

437
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:35,238
- I know!
- Bring it in here, guys.

438
00:18:35,363 --> 00:18:37,324
Damn!
This thing has twin turbines?

439
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,784
I'll forgive you for abandoning
us if you let me drive it.

440
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:40,768
That works for me.

441
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,245
I was just gonna give you
space cigarettes.

442
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,830
- I love having two moms.
- And I love having two wives!

443
00:18:44,914 --> 00:18:45,998
Never gonna happen, Jerry.

444
00:18:46,082 --> 00:18:47,708
You jerk-offs ready to get the answers

445
00:18:47,792 --> 00:18:49,294
to your burning questions?

446
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,337
What's this, Dad?

447
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,546
The memory of which Beth is real

448
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,480
and which Beth is a clone, obviously.

449
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,675
You mind-blew yourself?

450
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,511
Y-You literally don't even know
which of your daughters is real.

451
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:00,137
Of course you don't.
Why am I surprised?

452
00:19:00,221 --> 00:19:02,932
I'm sure you'd love for us
to need that from you,

453
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,642
but I don't care what's in that vial.

454
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:05,727
Yeah.
Me neither.

455
00:19:05,852 --> 00:19:07,061
You're a piece of shit either way.

456
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:09,146
So what, after all this, you
don't want to know the truth?

457
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:11,190
The truth is we have
more important shit to do,

458
00:19:11,274 --> 00:19:13,693
like raise our kids
and stamp out the Federation,

459
00:19:13,818 --> 00:19:17,155
neither of which seem like they
want anything to do with you.

460
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,034
Morty? Sum-Sum?

461
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:23,035
You got to at least want to know
who your real mom is.

462
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:25,369
Not really, Rick.
We have two badass moms now.

463
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:27,123
- It's kind of a win/win.
- Yeah, Grandpa Rick.

464
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,416
Don't drag us into your bullshit

465
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,460
just because you're losing control.

466
00:19:30,585 --> 00:19:32,128
Enh.

467
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:37,008
I know what I want to do.

468
00:19:37,133 --> 00:19:38,551
- I want you to decide.
- What?

469
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:41,179
For once in my life,
I want you to decide, Dad.

470
00:19:41,304 --> 00:19:43,681
Do you want me to stay here
and be part of your life,

471
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:45,767
