- Rick and Morty adventure.
- Yeah, right, Rick, I'm all-in.

516
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,156
No wonder you're
constantly fighting

517

Hello?

- He should be here any second.

It's funny, Jerry spent his life
seeking attention,

530
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,713
but in the end, humanity's
instinctive dismissal of him

531

saved an alien's life.

You have Gobo! You were supposed
to bring him to the hill!
