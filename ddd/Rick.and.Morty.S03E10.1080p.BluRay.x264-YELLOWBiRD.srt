Oh, we're not going anywhere.
This ends now.

Dad, if you're my dad.
Of course, you're not my dad.

519
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,562
You're here with a gun
because I am a clone.

520
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,226
I guess I have all
your daughter's memories.

521
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:03,773
So I guess I was her,
which makes me related to her.

522
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,110
But I don't relate to her.

523
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:09,232
She left her family and me,
which means I relate to them.

524
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:11,359
So if you kill me, fine.
You're not killing her.

525

But you're killing
a real family.

will you just go away?

any ability to fend you off.

easy for you to say that.

became an enemy of America

in my idiot family?

thing they have.

that I was motivated

by a fear of you leaving
can be eschewed.

Eschewed?
You've never used that word.
