1
00:00:01,918 --> 00:00:03,878
Morty's on Jessica's Instagram again.

2
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:05,103
Get out of here, jerk!

3
00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:06,547
What's so embarrassing, Morty?

4
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:08,048
Sharing it with your family might help.

5
00:00:08,132 --> 00:00:09,716
Summer, stop shaming your brother.

6
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,010
Morty, stop being a creepy,
perverted cyberstalker.

7
00:00:12,094 --> 00:00:13,638
I'm not cyberstalking!

8
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:16,598
I-I-I just wanted to know where
she got this necklace from.

9
00:00:16,682 --> 00:00:17,934
And now I know.

10
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:19,768
Her... Her... Her grandma left it to her.

11
00:00:19,852 --> 00:00:21,145
You're quiet, Rick.

12
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,480
Shouldn't you be revealing
grandmas aren't real?

13
00:00:23,564 --> 00:00:26,400
Hi. I've placed an auto-response
chip in my brain

14
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,611
so I can spend time with my family.

15
00:00:28,736 --> 00:00:31,113
But you <i>are</i> spending time
with your family.

16
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,739
Thank you for talking to Rick.

17
00:00:33,824 --> 00:00:35,075
Alright, I'm finished with my breakfast

18
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:36,702
and my Amazon wish list.
Let's go, Morty.

19
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:38,912
I need death crystals
from Forbodulon Prime.

20
00:00:38,996 --> 00:00:40,164
Uh...

21
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:43,709
Dad?
There's a way we do this now.

22
00:00:43,834 --> 00:00:46,921
Morty, would you <i>please</i> accompany me

23
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:49,799
to Forbodulon Prime for death crystals?

24
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:54,804
Well, thank you for asking.
Yes, I will do that.

25
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:56,472
It <i>is</i> a hot photo.

26
00:00:56,597 --> 00:00:58,975
I think grief flushes your cheeks.

27
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,851
Dad, you hardly put any syrup on.

28
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:02,603
Honey, stop raising
your father's cholesterol

29
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:04,271
so you can take a hot funeral selfie.

30
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:05,898
I never get to do anything.

31
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,933
Uh, Rick, maybe if we go a little...

32
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,393
Faster?
Good idea, Morty.

33
00:01:42,518 --> 00:01:44,729
It'll get us through these
asteroids sooner.

34
00:01:51,902 --> 00:01:54,238
Geez, you're really <i>this</i> pissed
about my mom making sure

35
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,823
I'm okay with our adventures?

36
00:01:55,948 --> 00:01:57,407
What's next, Morty?
What if I want you to jump off

37
00:01:57,491 --> 00:01:58,492
the Empire State Building?

38
00:01:58,576 --> 00:01:59,744
- I have to ask?
- Yes?

39
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:02,329
And you seriously don't see how
that's a slippery slope?

40
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:04,563
Just shut up and help me
with these, please.

41
00:02:04,665 --> 00:02:06,124
Why are they called death crystals?

42
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,376
D-Do they kill you?

43
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:08,961
You're thinking of bullets, Morty.

44
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,839
Death crystals show you
how you're gonna die.

45
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:17,803
Jesus Christ!
I-I die a million times?

46
00:02:17,928 --> 00:02:19,930
Your future stems from your present,

47
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:22,057
which, if you're living right,
keeps changing.

48
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:24,434
Truth is, anyone that knows how
they're definitely gonna die

49
00:02:24,518 --> 00:02:26,436
is either boring as hell
or about to get shot.

50
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,606
Duck!

51
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:29,857
Who are those guys?!

52
00:02:29,982 --> 00:02:31,192
Crystal poachers.

53
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,776
There's no lower form of life.

54
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,404
They think the galaxy's
their own personal piggy bank.

55
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,947
Wait, then what are we?

56
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,616
We're Rick and Morty.

57
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:41,285
You're about to witness the only
real use for these crystals.

58
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,328
They show you when
the other guy's reloading.

59
00:02:43,412 --> 00:02:47,166
Certain death, certain death,
certain death, uncertain death.

60
00:02:50,002 --> 00:02:52,505
And certain death,
certain death, certain death.

61
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,256
Definitely gonna get shot by this guy;

62
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,633
This is totally my fate;
Nothing I could possibly do;

63
00:02:56,717 --> 00:02:58,886
Okay, now, not so much.

64
00:02:59,011 --> 00:03:01,722
Help me gather these up.

65
00:03:06,852 --> 00:03:08,270
You just use these to win fights?

66
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,730
I don't use them.

67
00:03:09,855 --> 00:03:12,190
People that spend their life
avoiding death are already dead.

68
00:03:12,274 --> 00:03:15,319
They're also rich, and I like to
spend my life with their money.

69
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:16,778
- Oh, my God.
<i>- Morty!</i>

70
00:03:16,862 --> 00:03:19,240
Jessica!
Oh!

71
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,700
I love you.

72
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,368
Oh! Whoa! Whoa!

73
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:24,662
<i>- Morty.</i>
- Oh! Oh! Oh!

74
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:25,996
<i>I love you.</i>

75
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:30,793
Jessica.
I want to die with Jessica.

76
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,316
- Ahh!
- What are you doing?

77
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,928
- Oh, um, c-can I drive?
- Why?

78
00:03:41,053 --> 00:03:43,431
The... feel of the open road?

79
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,349
Alright!
Who's this grandson?

80
00:03:45,474 --> 00:03:47,810
I like his style.

81
00:03:47,935 --> 00:03:49,895
Morty, you know outer space is up, right?

82
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:53,357
Yeah, yeah. I'm just, uh,
following... my... instincts.

83
00:03:53,482 --> 00:03:55,192
- Will you just go up?
- Stop!

84
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,443
You're gonna make me die wrong!

85
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:57,486
Wait a minute, <i>what?</i>

86
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,112
Morty, do you have
a death crystal in your pocket?

87
00:03:59,196 --> 00:04:00,572
- No! Maybe!
- You little monster!

88
00:04:00,656 --> 00:04:01,823
I thought you were masturbating!

89
00:04:01,907 --> 00:04:02,991
And you took that in stride?!

90
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:03,992
You'd rather I address it?!

91
00:04:04,076 --> 00:04:05,327
Why would I be doing it?!

92
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:06,370
Why would you steal a death crystal?!

93
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:07,354
I want to die old!

94
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:08,414
Then stop driving!

95
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:09,581
- No!
- You son of a bitch!

96
00:04:09,665 --> 00:04:10,874
Give me the wheel, Morty.

97
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,543
Goddamn it.

98
00:04:21,802 --> 00:04:23,929
Ohhh, shit.

99
00:04:24,054 --> 00:04:26,348
Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit.

100
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,851
<i>I love you, Morty.</i>

101
00:04:28,976 --> 00:04:31,479
I will avenge my death.

102
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,147
- Holy shit!
- Just kidding.

103
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:35,399
I'm a crisis detection
and correction hologram

104
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:38,694
generated by a chip that
"real" Rick put in your spine.

105
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:41,697
"Real" in quotes because calling
density-privileged entities

106
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,365
"real" is incredibly holo-phobic.

107
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,867
Morty, do me a solid...
Problematic wordplay aside...

108
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,703
Grab the gun with the blue
handle from the trunk

109
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:51,499
and get a tissue sample from the corpse.

110
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,292
Alright, now take that to the trunk

111
00:04:54,376 --> 00:04:58,005
and insert it into the clone compiler.

112
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,215
I see you appear to be holding
a death crystal

113
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:02,300
that's guiding your decisions
more than I am.

114
00:05:02,384 --> 00:05:03,969
That's your right.

115
00:05:04,094 --> 00:05:06,596
I just want to remind you that
some people can't hold anything

116
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,433
and can never die, so that's
a little offensive to

117
00:05:09,558 --> 00:05:12,978
Oh, okay.

118
00:05:13,103 --> 00:05:15,481
Listen, I'm programmed
for tolerance, Morty.

119
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,399
So I'm willing to accept
that you're doing this

120
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,933
if you're willing to accept
that you need to stop.

121
00:05:24,156 --> 00:05:26,075
<i>Accepting.
Rerouted.</i>

122
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,454
<i>Backup. Data.
Operation. Phoenix. Initiated.</i>

123
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:36,210
What the hell?
I axed this protocol.

124
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:37,878
What are you doing with my clone?

125
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:39,380
It's okay. I'm you.

126
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,757
I took my own clone vat offline
a couple seasons ago,

127
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,510
so I think my backup got
rerouted to your universe.

128
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,679
- I'm sorry.
- All good. Happy to help.

129
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,972
By the way, annoying
that I even have to ask,

130
00:05:49,056 --> 00:05:52,977
but you are down with
fascist dystopias, right?

131
00:05:56,438 --> 00:05:58,607
YYYYYes.

132
00:05:58,732 --> 00:06:00,233
That "yes" was pretty

133
00:06:00,317 --> 00:06:02,236
liberal
with the letter "Y."

134
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:04,530
Well, isn't this strange.

135
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,907
I trust, the kind of strange
that makes Rick and Morty

136
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,341
stronger.

137
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,452
Morty, I caught this socialist
in my bathrobe.

138
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,828
He wants to give all of our martinis

139
00:06:11,912 --> 00:06:13,079
to a family of immigrants.

140
00:06:13,163 --> 00:06:14,539
Obviously, the most likely impostor

141
00:06:14,623 --> 00:06:16,750
- is the wet, naked clone.
- It is obvious.

142
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,502
But it won't be to the police.

143
00:06:18,627 --> 00:06:20,671
- Ohh!
- 'Kay.

144
00:06:20,796 --> 00:06:23,006
He was an inferior Rick.
He was too political.

145
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:25,091
I want to have fun, classic
Rick-and-Morty adventures

146
00:06:25,175 --> 00:06:26,385
like in the old days.

147
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,512
Then we'll get along fine, Fascist Morty.

148
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,764
For starters, I just need to get
to Forbodulon Prime...

149
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,808
You will go where I want you to go!!

150
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:34,059
Fuck.

151
00:06:35,477 --> 00:06:37,229
Hey, hey! Ho, ho!

152
00:06:37,354 --> 00:06:39,315
Not cloning your grandpa has got to go!

153
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,108
Hey, hey! Ho, ho!

154
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:42,984
Not cloning your grandpa has got to go!

155
00:06:43,068 --> 00:06:45,320
You don't get out of my face,
I'm gonna flush Rick's DNA.

156
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:48,198
Alright.
Okay, regroup, everybody.

157
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:49,825
You, too, Berkeley!

158
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,118
Snap out of it.

159
00:06:51,243 --> 00:06:52,786
At least tell me what this death is

160
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,622
that you're so determined to...

161
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:58,876
Oh. Jessica.

162
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:01,378
<i>Morty, I love...</i>

163
00:07:01,503 --> 00:07:05,466
What?! No, no!
No, no, no!

164
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,343
<i>I love you.</i>

165
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:09,094
Damn it!

166
00:07:09,219 --> 00:07:10,971
How am I gonna die with her
if I can't even talk to her?

167
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,639
Here's an idea, Morty.
Throw that thing in the garbage,

168
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,724
stop planning your own death,
and talk to whoever you want.

169
00:07:14,808 --> 00:07:16,059
Now you just sound like Real Rick.

170
00:07:16,143 --> 00:07:17,519
You're better than that language, Morty.

171
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,480
I ain't better than shit, Jack.

172
00:07:22,566 --> 00:07:24,109
So, uh, w-what are we doing?

173
00:07:24,234 --> 00:07:26,820
Stop asking questions.
Stop doing meta-commentary.

174
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,238
Just have fun.

175
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,365
We're going on a simple,
fun, classic adventure.

176
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:32,242
Okay, you know what?
It would really help

177
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:35,496
if you could just say anything
other than what you don't want.

178
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:36,997
I like Mr. Meeseeks.

179
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:38,874
Okay, now we're talking.
You know what?

180
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,042
I usually keep a Meeseeks box
in my glove compartment,

181
00:07:41,126 --> 00:07:43,379
so maybe Fascist Rick does, too.

182
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:44,880
Ah!
Well, look at that.

183
00:07:45,005 --> 00:07:47,466
Now we're doing something
we've done before.

184
00:07:47,591 --> 00:07:49,051
I'm Mr. Meeseeks!

185
00:07:49,176 --> 00:07:50,302
Kill this Nazi prick!

186
00:07:50,427 --> 00:07:51,971
Can do!

187
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:54,246
- Come here, you son of a bitch!
- No! Stop!

188
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,065
<i>Accepting. Rerouted.</i>

189
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:08,696
<i>Backup. Data.
Operation. Phoenix. Initiated.</i>

190
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:13,075
Aw, come on, man.

191
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,410
Whoa, are you okay?

192
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:15,661
Yeah, sorry.

193
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,203
I'm a Rick from another reality.

194
00:08:17,287 --> 00:08:19,081
I-I got uploaded to your clone vat.

195
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:21,207
Hey, don't worry about it, man.
I have a dozen.

196
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:22,626
W-W-What the heck, Rick?

197
00:08:22,751 --> 00:08:24,169
Are you making clones down here?

198
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,379
Get outta here, Morty!

199
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:26,880
Stop asking stupid questions, Morty!

200
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:27,923
You sound like a piece of shit.

201
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,425
Aw, geez.

202
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,200
So, tell the truth, man.
No shame.

203
00:08:31,301 --> 00:08:33,511
You're looking at
your shrimp body like "What?!"

204
00:08:33,595 --> 00:08:35,305
Ah, is it that obvious?
I'm sorry.

205
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:38,350
Yeah, my original body is more
bipedal... uh, ape-descended.

206
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,643
Really! Weird.

207
00:08:39,768 --> 00:08:41,061
Does your house look like a tree, or...

208
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,354
No, it looks like this.

209
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,606
It's, like, identical to this, actually.

210
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:45,983
That is such a mind-fuck.

211
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,525
It's all good, man.
I'm fine with it.

212
00:08:47,609 --> 00:08:49,235
Honestly, you're doing me a huge favor

213
00:08:49,319 --> 00:08:51,822
by being shrimp instead of fascists.

214
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,116
What?

215
00:08:54,241 --> 00:08:55,408
Goddamn it!

216
00:08:55,492 --> 00:08:57,442
When did this shit become the default?!

217
00:08:59,621 --> 00:09:02,207
Who wants to come up to the board

218
00:09:02,332 --> 00:09:03,875
and show me some basic-ass integers?

219
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:05,377
<i>- I love you, Morty.
- Aah!</i>

220
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:10,758
Morty?
Yeah, right.

221
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:15,471
That's not an integer!

222
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,139
Apparently, it doesn't matter.

223
00:09:17,264 --> 00:09:18,682
Damn, Morty, you're bad at math,

224
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,684
but I'm giving you
an A-plus in confidence.

225
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:21,935
Just doin' what I gotta do.

226
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,021
Extra credit!

227
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:28,692
<i>I love you, Morty.
I love you, Morty.</i>

228
00:09:28,817 --> 00:09:30,027
What's with the strut?

229
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,611
- You think you own this school?
- Nope!

230
00:09:31,695 --> 00:09:34,072
What if I killed you?
Would you be strutting then?

231
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,783
Only if the events of the Pixar
movie "Coco" are to be believed,

232
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:37,868
which I doubt.

233
00:09:37,993 --> 00:09:39,343
I have it on good authority

234
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:40,996
that you're probably not gonna kill me.

235
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,623
So why don't you do what I do

236
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:47,628
and just go with the flow,
nice and Zen, baby.

237
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,881
Aah! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!

238
00:09:51,006 --> 00:09:52,758
Ugh! Impotence!

239
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:58,055
Aah! Impotent rage!

240
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,932
Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!

241
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:03,268
You die tomorrow, no matter what.

242
00:10:03,393 --> 00:10:07,356
It's what bullies call
a "fait accompli."

243
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,983
- Oh, man! Oh, shit!
- Well, well, well. Mm.

244
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,777
Looks like you got yourself in
a lick of trouble, huh, Morty?

245
00:10:12,861 --> 00:10:14,612
Okay, okay, look, if you help me not die,

246
00:10:14,696 --> 00:10:16,281
I'll bring Rick back to life.

247
00:10:16,406 --> 00:10:18,283
Why are you pretending to eat chicken?

248
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,535
Excuse me?

249
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,827
This chicken is quite real to me.

250
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,162
Yeah, okay, but it doesn't have...

251
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:23,372
- Nutrients?
- Yeah.

252
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:24,497
What's the last thing you ate?

253
00:10:24,581 --> 00:10:25,498
Baloney and an orange.

254
00:10:25,582 --> 00:10:26,917
So, no holographic foods?

255
00:10:27,042 --> 00:10:28,752
So, to me, you never ate?

256
00:10:28,877 --> 00:10:30,336
Or we could try respecting each other.

257
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,464
Will you just show me how to stay alive?

258
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:33,965
Alright, Morty, a deal's a deal.

259
00:10:34,049 --> 00:10:35,717
Once we bring your Rick back to life,

260
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,501
then I'll help you with the bully.

261
00:10:37,594 --> 00:10:39,888
Go ahead and open the hatch
to the subterranean lab.

262
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,022
That's where all
the cloning equipment is.

263
00:10:43,308 --> 00:10:45,769
Please tell me you're not
hitting that crystal again.

264
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:49,148
Look, Rick might be the epitome
of bloated flesh privilege,

265
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,941
but he's right about one thing.

266
00:10:51,066 --> 00:10:53,234
You're gonna be a lot happier
if you focus on the moment,

267
00:10:53,318 --> 00:10:54,903
rather than on how you're gonna die.

268
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,362
I mean, w-who's worried about that, huh?

269
00:10:56,446 --> 00:10:57,781
Sorry, Hologram Rick.

270
00:10:57,906 --> 00:11:00,284
I'm going with the crystal on this one.

271
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,161
<i>Morty.</i>

272
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:03,954
Oh, alright, okay.

273
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,081
Just because I can't interact
with solid matter

274
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,375
means you can just walk all over me?

275
00:11:09,918 --> 00:11:11,753
Dear God.

276
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,427
Bist du faschistisch?

277
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:19,511
Nope.

278
00:11:24,641 --> 00:11:25,726
Finally.

279
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,936
I thought maybe you were pussying out.

280
00:11:28,061 --> 00:11:29,021
Hyah!

281
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:30,105
What the fuck?

282
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,690
Oh, the air's getting thin!

283
00:11:31,815 --> 00:11:34,526
Well, well, well, looks like
there's a new bully in town!

284
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,613
Lucky for us, he just made
bully-bullying the new bullying!

285
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:40,532
Bully him!

286
00:11:40,657 --> 00:11:42,618
Aah!

287
00:11:43,827 --> 00:11:45,286
We've got an Akira-type
situation going on

288
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,831
behind the mall.
Over.

289
00:11:47,956 --> 00:11:49,791
Dying with Jessica...

290
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,585
Hey!

291
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,338
What the hell?

292
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,798
Aah! Aah!

293
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,304
I'm Mr. Meeseeks!
Look at me!

294
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:04,097
Shield me from the law!

295
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,516
- Yes, sir! Can do!
- Stand down!

296
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,602
Look at me!

297
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,911
I... will... die... old!

298
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:28,288
Up next, an unstoppable
science-fiction boy

299
00:12:28,413 --> 00:12:30,707
is attacking our nation's
final line of defense.

300
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,500
Will we all fall to his deadly touch?

301
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:34,211
But first, something silly?

302
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,712
What do you mean, "but first"?

303
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,996
I already said "up next."
You always do this.

304
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,175
I don't <i>always</i> do shit.
Don't gaslight me.

305
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,593
Gaslighting doesn't exist.

306
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,777
You made it up
'cause you're fucking crazy.

307
00:13:01,196 --> 00:13:03,365
Why are you letting me do this?

308
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:06,410
I do as the crystal guides.

309
00:13:08,036 --> 00:13:10,205
Your Honor, my client was acting
in self-defense.

310
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,582
He turned 13 men into piles of ash.

311
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,876
Sit down!
Before I sentence you,

312
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:18,005
is there anything
you have to say for yourself?

313
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:24,886
I... w-w-will a-al-sways...

314
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:32,012
Always r-r-remember o-our...

315
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:38,317
Our... our... v-v-t-time...
Time

316
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:43,238
i-in... f-g-g-g-P-P-Peru.

317
00:13:43,363 --> 00:13:45,991
I will always remember our time
in Peru, Your Honor.

318
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,576
Your Honor,

319
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:50,203
as you can see, my client
is speaking nonsense.

320
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,496
Stop.

321
00:13:51,621 --> 00:13:54,207
Those were my husband's last words.

322
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:58,337
He says that he... I-loves you

323
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:03,008
ttt-llll-lit-lit-little... little

324
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:09,306
ff-gg-sp-spa-ffggarrow...

325
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:10,557
Sparrow!

326
00:14:10,682 --> 00:14:12,225
He loves you, little sparrow.

327
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:15,979
He's innocent.
Case dismissed.

328
00:14:16,104 --> 00:14:18,732
I'm coming for you, Condor!

329
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:21,985
Well, I, for one, will not be
accepting this verdict.

330
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:25,030
And this little monster may
think he's gotten away,

331
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,282
but there is something called
the court of public opinion

332
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,325
that still has final say in this country.

333
00:14:29,409 --> 00:14:30,743
Oh, I guess he's coming out
of the courthouse now.

334
00:14:30,827 --> 00:14:32,204
Let's go live to that.

335
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,303
People, I gotta tell you something.

336
00:14:48,428 --> 00:14:49,763
That little boy...

337
00:14:49,888 --> 00:14:51,931
I thought I knew everything
about everything.

338
00:14:52,015 --> 00:14:55,102
But something about the tones
and frequencies

339
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,020
that just came out of his mouth
have made me...

340
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:59,647
I mean, I think we're just about
ready to forgive him

341
00:14:59,731 --> 00:15:02,191
and move past this whole thing.
He's a free young man.

342
00:15:02,275 --> 00:15:06,029
And as far as continuity goes,
the reset button's been hit.

343
00:15:06,154 --> 00:15:08,949
Morty!
That was a fast trial.

344
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,493
Jess-i-ca?

345
00:15:11,618 --> 00:15:13,494
A bunch of us girls were gonna
go skinny-dipping later,

346
00:15:13,578 --> 00:15:14,996
if you wanted to join.

347
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,415
Actually, now, really.
We're gonna do it right now.

348
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,250
This is the last conversation
I'm having about it

349
00:15:19,334 --> 00:15:20,501
fully clothed.

350
00:15:20,585 --> 00:15:21,795
No, thanks.

351
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,881
I'm... assuming...
we... maybe

352
00:15:25,006 --> 00:15:27,926
get together...
in our 40s?

353
00:15:28,051 --> 00:15:29,719
Uh, cool.

354
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:32,055
Sounds... hot.

355
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,223
Bye.

356
00:15:33,348 --> 00:15:36,059
Must... continue...
moving

357
00:15:36,184 --> 00:15:40,480
in ways... that lead...
to dying... with you.

358
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,236
Whoa!
Way to use up a clone!

359
00:15:46,361 --> 00:15:48,113
What the fuck, man?

360
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:50,114
What's the matter with you?
Y-Y-You don't talk?

361
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:51,533
Tarantula got your tongue?

362
00:15:51,658 --> 00:15:55,829
Uh...
Heil, Wasp Hitler?

363
00:15:55,954 --> 00:15:57,080
What?
What the fuck?

364
00:15:57,205 --> 00:15:58,623
Where's that shit coming from?

365
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:01,084
Look, I'm a primate.
I-I'm having a hard time.

366
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:02,960
I'll think or say whatever gets me home.

367
00:16:03,044 --> 00:16:05,005
Well, here's how it works with wasps.

368
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,006
We eat our prey alive, and when we don't,

369
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,508
we lay our eggs in their eyeballs

370
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,301
so that our young can feast
on their brains

371
00:16:10,385 --> 00:16:11,720
when they hatch.

372
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,304
When you're born that big an asshole,

373
00:16:13,388 --> 00:16:15,598
the least you can do is
have a little empathy.

374
00:16:15,682 --> 00:16:18,477
Now, come have dinner
with my beautiful family.

375
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,061
And drop the Hitler stuff.

376
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,689
Wasp Morty's been on
some crazy message boards.

377
00:16:22,814 --> 00:16:24,483
Aah! Aah!

378
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,526
Oh! Aah! Ow!

379
00:16:26,651 --> 00:16:27,985
Me and my friends want to fly around

380
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:29,487
and look for something to sting tonight.

381
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,447
You be careful not to waste
all your venom.

382
00:16:31,531 --> 00:16:33,700
I'm not a bee, Dad.

383
00:16:33,825 --> 00:16:36,786
Oh, God! Kill me!
Please kill me!

384
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,623
Uh, Beth, uh, after dinner,
could I maybe borrow Morty

385
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:42,792
to help the lost Rick get back
to his primate-based reality?

386
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,752
Morty, are you done with your homework?

387
00:16:44,836 --> 00:16:47,172
- Not all of it.
- Sorry, Dad.

388
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,715
Oh, don't be sorry, sweetie.
We're all in this together.

389
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:51,635
We're wasps, not monsters.

390
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,011
Aah!

391
00:16:53,136 --> 00:16:55,514
Huh, guess I don't have it
as bad as I thought.

392
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:58,016
Can you pass the acid?

393
00:16:58,141 --> 00:17:00,769
Aah! No!
Run! Run, my babies!

394
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,062
Bonus!

395
00:17:06,107 --> 00:17:07,484
- Morty?
- Morty?

396
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,193
Where is that little shit?
Morty!

397
00:17:09,277 --> 00:17:10,529
Whoa, garage foul.

398
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:12,029
Who said you could go through my stuff?

399
00:17:12,113 --> 00:17:13,448
W-Where's my Boglin?

400
00:17:13,573 --> 00:17:15,784
There you are.
Don't worry, Pop-pop's back.

401
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,452
I'll keep you safe.
What the...

402
00:17:17,577 --> 00:17:20,163
He took my Meeseeks boxes!
All that's left are these

403
00:17:20,288 --> 00:17:22,832
shitty Kirkland brand Meeseeks boxes.

404
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,043
What do you want?

405
00:17:25,168 --> 00:17:27,420
Damn, your Morty sucks.

406
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,547
Aah, wasps!

407
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:29,922
Why the hell didn't you show Morty

408
00:17:30,006 --> 00:17:31,382
how to bring my body back to life?

409
00:17:31,466 --> 00:17:32,717
Don't tell me you gained sentience

410
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,260
- and tried to take over.
- What?

411
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,012
That is some A.I.,
racist, accusatory,

412
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,763
Isaac Asimov bullshit right there.

413
00:17:37,847 --> 00:17:39,557
Then what happened?
Where's my body?

414
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:41,726
Oh, you're gonna love this.

415
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:10,797
<i>- I love you, Morty.
- This is my life.</i>

416
00:18:10,922 --> 00:18:13,174
<i>This is good.</i>

417
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,262
What do ya know?

418
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:18,638
Our little Morty knows how to scream.

419
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,390
Oh, you're fucked now!
I told you!

420
00:18:20,515 --> 00:18:24,060
Get him, Rick!

421
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,860
Aaaah!

422
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,903
Aah!
I-I can't see my own death.

423
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,363
H-How am I gonna die?!

424
00:18:35,488 --> 00:18:37,115
Shh, quiet, idiot.
Quiet.

425
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,575
It's gonna be alright.

426
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,076
You don't get to know
how you're gonna die.

427
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,120
It's over.
Oh, hey.

428
00:18:42,245 --> 00:18:44,914
This fucking ferrofluid's
wrapping around my legs.

429
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,460
Fuck!
I can feel! I have mass!

430
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:51,087
I'm a fucking god now!
You're fucked!

431
00:18:51,212 --> 00:18:52,589
What the fuck?

432
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,590
I-I thought you were proud
to be a hologram!

433
00:18:54,674 --> 00:18:56,885
That's 'cause I had to fucking be one!

434
00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:03,725
Shit! Aaah!

435
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:07,062
Ugh! Aaah!

436
00:19:12,817 --> 00:19:14,277
There's a lesson here,

437
00:19:14,402 --> 00:19:17,113
and I'm not the one
that's gonna figure it out.

438
00:19:17,238 --> 00:19:19,532
Hey, uh, sorry I didn't listen to you

439
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,325
and tried to kill
the whole world and stuff.

440
00:19:21,409 --> 00:19:22,702
I guess I got to learn

441
00:19:22,827 --> 00:19:24,203
how to live in the moment a little more.

442
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,247
Oh, boy, so, you actually
learned something today?

443
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,623
What is this, "Full House"?

444
00:19:27,707 --> 00:19:29,125
I was living in the moment all day,

445
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,876
and it kept getting me killed by Nazis.

446
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,129
I think you have to think ahead
<i>and</i> live in the moment.

447
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,465
Morty, we saw you on the news.
Are you okay?

448
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:38,510
Oh, real nice, Rick.
Turning our son into an Akira?

449
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,512
- Real nice.
- Eat my ass, Jerry.

450
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:42,180
He turned himself into Akira.

451
00:19:42,305 --> 00:19:44,933
Oh, I'll eat it,
because this is my house, Rick.

452
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,642
- I'll eat any ass I want.
- Gross.

453
00:19:46,726 --> 00:19:48,394
You said the crystals wouldn't
hurt anyone, Dad.

454
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,021
This family has a clean start.

455
00:19:50,146 --> 00:19:52,315
I don't know if adventures
fit into my son's life.

456
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,401
I'm fine.
Get off Rick's back.

457
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,902
Rick wasn't even here
when I was doing all that stuff.

458
00:19:56,986 --> 00:19:58,113
That was all on me.

459
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,031
Well, alright, Morty.

460
00:20:00,156 --> 00:20:03,284
I guess, as long as you're okay,
that's all we care about.

461
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,662
I don't want to see any more anime stuff

462
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,330
happening to my son, buster.

463
00:20:07,455 --> 00:20:09,248
That finger has AIDS now.
Not my fault.

464
00:20:09,332 --> 00:20:10,792
You skipped HIV?

465
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:13,044
- He's messing with you, sweetie.
- But it's tingling!

466
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,504
So, I guess what we learned
is to split the diff.

467
00:20:15,588 --> 00:20:16,672
From now on, Rick and Morty doing

468
00:20:16,756 --> 00:20:18,049
a little of this and a little of that.

469
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,759
Yeah, sometimes we'll do classic stuff.

470
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:21,010
You know, other times, we'll do whatever!

471
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,345
Sometimes we won't even do anything!

472
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,804
Rick and Morty do... not doing anything!

473
00:20:23,888 --> 00:20:25,264
- A hundred years!
- Pushing it to the limit.

474
00:20:25,348 --> 00:20:26,724
Rick and Morty, not sticking to one path.

475
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,008
Trying different things,

476
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:29,769
Making sure to keep out of a rut.

477
00:20:29,894 --> 00:20:31,395
Doing stuff.
Sometimes not doing stuff.

478
00:20:31,479 --> 00:20:33,272
Not even pushing a little bit
towards the limit.

479
00:20:33,356 --> 00:20:34,774
Doing it alone or together.
Making sure to keep our eyes

480
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,442
on the prize.
Sometimes just relaxing.

481
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:38,527
Or not. And you can do whatever
the fuck you want, Morty.

482
00:20:38,611 --> 00:20:40,529
- That's the end.
- Wait, wait, what the fuck?

483
00:20:40,613 --> 00:20:42,406
H-Hold on. What the fuck
did you just say?

484
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:43,992
Nothing.
I didn't say anything.

485
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:45,660
I was just playing along with you guys.

486
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,536
You know I record everything, right?

487
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,290
Garage, isolate Summer's voice
and play back.

488
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,707
<i>Oh, and then you guys can get married,</i>

489
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:52,750
<i>and, like, suck each other off</i>

490
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,001
<i>in a testosterone-addled</i>

491
00:20:54,085 --> 00:20:55,378
<i>fucking third-grade-boy cumfest.</i>

492
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:56,712
What, the hell, Summer?!
That's disgusting.

493
00:20:56,796 --> 00:20:58,548
Fucking gross, Summer!
Jesus Christ!

494
00:20:58,673 --> 00:21:00,633
I was just joking around, you...

495
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,136
Just seeing if you guys
pay any attention to me.

496
00:21:03,261 --> 00:21:04,428
Just want to be a part of the fun.

497
00:21:04,512 --> 00:21:05,554
Get the fuck out of here!

498
00:21:05,638 --> 00:21:06,838
Get out of here, Summer!

499
00:21:06,931 --> 00:21:08,057
- Fucking disgusting!
- Get out of here!

500
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,558
You ruined the Season 4 premiere!

501
00:21:09,642 --> 00:21:12,145
The Season 4 premiere, you ruined it!

502
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,261
God, tomorrow's career day.

503
00:21:45,386 --> 00:21:47,805
I don't want to think about what
I do when I get out of school.

504
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,891
I know exactly what I want to do.

505
00:21:50,016 --> 00:21:51,643
I want to work in hospice.

506
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:54,062
I want to comfort
the people who are dying,

507
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:56,147
who have no one else in their lives...

508
00:21:56,272 --> 00:21:58,066
The real lonely people.

509
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,359
I'm gonna look at their name
tags, and I'm gonna say,

510
00:22:00,443 --> 00:22:02,278
"I love you,"

511
00:22:02,403 --> 00:22:04,238
followed by whatever it says
on their name tag,

512
00:22:04,322 --> 00:22:06,199
over and over.

513
00:22:06,324 --> 00:22:07,867
What the fuck?

514
00:22:09,285 --> 00:22:10,485
Hey, Morty, quick favor.

515
00:22:10,578 --> 00:22:11,996
What, cover me in gasoline and spiders?

516
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,206
Fine, yeah, I'm in.

517
00:22:13,331 --> 00:22:14,833
Wasn't my first pitch,

518
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,877
but, hey, not gonna waste
this opportunity.
