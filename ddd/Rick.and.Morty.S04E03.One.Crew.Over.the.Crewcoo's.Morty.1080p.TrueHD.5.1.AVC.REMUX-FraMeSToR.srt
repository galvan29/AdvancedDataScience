1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:03,794
Rick, I-I'm not rated
to climb something this sheer.

2
00:00:03,878 --> 00:00:06,171
Look, you're the guy
that wanted an epic adventure.

3
00:00:06,255 --> 00:00:07,965
I'm the guy with only one hover chair.

4
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:10,259
Goddammit, an alien spider
just bit my finger!

5
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:11,344
It's an alien cliff.

6
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:13,179
You can just say spider.

7
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:16,933
You couldn't do that an hour ago?

8
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:19,227
I was eating, and you're dirty.

9
00:00:22,146 --> 00:00:23,814
Activate anti-booby suits.

10
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,039
Total waste of snakes.

11
00:00:40,164 --> 00:00:41,415
If you want to take a beat

12
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:43,083
to acknowledge the sacred atmosphere,

13
00:00:43,167 --> 00:00:44,334
it could give the cynical grave robbing

14
00:00:44,418 --> 00:00:45,711
a hint of irreverence.

15
00:00:45,836 --> 00:00:47,254
- No, I'm... I'm good.
- All right, then.

16
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:48,798
Let's loop this corpse.

17
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:52,343
Hey, where's the...

18
00:00:52,468 --> 00:00:53,553
Wait, what?

19
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:55,137
Is that an origami horse?

20
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:58,891
It's a calling card from Miles
Knightley, a heist artist,

21
00:00:59,016 --> 00:01:00,309
AKA a hipster dick

22
00:01:00,434 --> 00:01:02,519
whose adventures are 60%
putting a crew together

23
00:01:02,603 --> 00:01:04,354
and 40% revealing that
the robbery already happened,

24
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:05,788
and he's not worth our time

25
00:01:05,898 --> 00:01:07,441
because he's a hack piece of shit fuck!

26
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:09,026
I'm gonna kill him!
Let's go, Morty.

27
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,905
This temple's for fuckin'
lame baby dipshits.

28
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,408
Who disturbs my slumber?

29
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:18,452
Also, who rigs a tomb
to crush the buried person?

30
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:19,953
Isn't the point to protect...

31
00:01:20,037 --> 00:01:21,247
Aah!

32
00:01:56,198 --> 00:01:58,868
- This dork.
- He has a convention now?

33
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:00,077
Come on.
What are we doing?

34
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,246
Huh!
Tuxedo scuba lessons? Ooh!

35
00:02:02,371 --> 00:02:05,916
A signing with Catherines
Alpha through Omega Joneses!

36
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,376
You know, this is great source material

37
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,794
for this heist movie that I'm writing.

38
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,587
Don't get drawn into the culture, Morty.

39
00:02:10,671 --> 00:02:13,048
Stealing stuff is about
the stuff, not the stealing.

40
00:02:13,132 --> 00:02:14,675
Where is the entrance?

41
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,010
Oh, brother.

42
00:02:18,512 --> 00:02:21,932
More like Trying Too Hard Con.

43
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,008
- Guests or professionals?
- Uh, guests.

44
00:02:24,101 --> 00:02:26,603
-Uh... Uh, guests are fans,
-Morty, which we are not.

45
00:02:26,687 --> 00:02:28,189
We'd like professional badges.

46
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,732
- Do you have a crew?
- Yes.

47
00:02:29,857 --> 00:02:31,608
He's a getaway driver with Asperger's,

48
00:02:31,692 --> 00:02:33,610
and my butthole is a demolitions expert.

49
00:02:33,694 --> 00:02:35,321
How much is it to get in?

50
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:38,448
If you want professional badges,
you need to put a crew together.

51
00:02:38,532 --> 00:02:40,492
Or we could sneak in like professionals.

52
00:02:40,576 --> 00:02:42,244
- Can't wait.
- Whoa!

53
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,498
Oh, for God's sake.

54
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,875
And you wonder why we aren't fans.

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,503
Let that ointment sit
for 10 minutes or you'll die.

56
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,046
Don't let it sit for 12

57
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:53,839
or I'll have to hunt down
what you become.

58
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,549
Can't you just buy a guest badge?

59
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:56,717
Fuck you for asking, Morty.

60
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,051
That would be a symbolic expression

61
00:02:58,135 --> 00:02:59,428
of support for this genre.

62
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,721
Then how do we get in?

63
00:03:00,846 --> 00:03:03,015
With a little help from some old friends.

64
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:09,063
Rick Sanchez, you son of a bitch!

65
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:10,938
Need some people for a thing, Glar.

66
00:03:11,023 --> 00:03:12,817
My name's Gleer these days.

67
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,193
I play piano.

68
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:16,779
Hey, Gleer.
Play your piano.

69
00:03:16,904 --> 00:03:18,531
I quit! Augh!

70
00:03:19,865 --> 00:03:23,077
And the name's Glar!

71
00:03:27,748 --> 00:03:30,501
Sanchez, you son of a bitch.

72
00:03:30,626 --> 00:03:32,503
Never thought I'd see Angie Flint

73
00:03:32,628 --> 00:03:33,795
picking ticks off a pig.

74
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:35,297
Nobody's hiring an ex-con

75
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:37,341
with fake hands to build an ion engine.

76
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:40,052
Suppose I had a job that didn't
care if you'd done time

77
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,972
or whatever's going on
with your confusing-ass hands.

78
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,640
I'm in.

79
00:03:47,309 --> 00:03:48,352
Is this the guy?

80
00:03:48,477 --> 00:03:49,437
No.

81
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:50,563
That the guy?

82
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:53,441
Nope.

83
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:54,483
- Him?
- No.

84
00:03:54,608 --> 00:03:55,901
No, wait. Y-Yes.

85
00:03:56,026 --> 00:03:57,027
Yeah, of course that's the guy.

86
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,821
Hey... Hey, Truckula!

87
00:03:58,946 --> 00:04:00,698
You son of a bitch!
I'm in!

88
00:04:09,498 --> 00:04:11,250
Thanks for doing this, guys.

89
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:15,212
- What's the job?
- That was it. Bye.

90
00:04:15,337 --> 00:04:19,133
And then, the police stole the paintings

91
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:23,012
because the police were us
in police outfits.

92
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:24,555
Thank you!

93
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,973
It's showtime, Morty,

94
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:27,766
and I don't mean a bad impression of HBO.

95
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,894
I mean, "Time for a show."

96
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,687
Another heist question from a fan?

97
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,188
Uh, how about a rhetorical one

98
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:36,108
from someone that had to be
reminded that you exist?

99
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:39,779
Hey, pal!
That's not the question line!

100
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,238
Lab coat...
Ripoff Dr. Strange.

101
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,907
Wha...

102
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:47,119
Rick Sanchez, everyone.
Smartest man in the universe.

103
00:04:47,244 --> 00:04:49,663
And a savage critic of the heisting arts.

104
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:50,914
Your boos mean nothing!

105
00:04:50,998 --> 00:04:52,583
I've seen what makes you cheer!

106
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:55,127
My question is,
"Seriously?"

107
00:04:55,252 --> 00:04:56,378
Lab coat... end ripoff.

108
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,755
Aah!

109
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,881
You stole the gem I needed
to split tachyons

110
00:04:59,965 --> 00:05:01,550
and probably fenced it

111
00:05:01,675 --> 00:05:03,677
so the 80 people that did all
the work could each buy a beer.

112
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,554
You're not an artist, you're Postmates.

113
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,474
I doubt this rivalry
can be settled with words.

114
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,935
Why don't we make things interesting?

115
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:15,439
I challenge you to a heist of
the crystal skull of Horowitz.

116
00:05:15,564 --> 00:05:16,941
In a heist off!

117
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,152
That doesn't make things interesting.

118
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,836
It makes them "Ocean's Twelve,"
by far the worst one.

119
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,990
Every breath I take
without your permission

120
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,492
raises my self-esteem!

121
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:27,701
State your terms.

122
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,037
First crew to heist the skull wins.

123
00:05:30,162 --> 00:05:32,832
The other endures
heist culture's greatest shame.

124
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,499
They must join the winning crew.

125
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,210
Lame. I accept.

126
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:38,587
Please welcome Knightley's Eight!

127
00:05:38,712 --> 00:05:42,550
Snake Arms! Double Microwave!
Monitor Lord! Key Catcher!

128
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:46,303
The Shape Shiftress!
Angie Flint! Glar! And Truckula.

129
00:05:46,428 --> 00:05:47,846
Hey!
Half of Knightley's Eight

130
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,723
are just three of Sanchez's Five!

131
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,351
Well, no heist is complete
without a double cross,

132
00:05:52,476 --> 00:05:53,685
and I had the perfect job.

133
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:57,439
Heisting the crystal skull.

134
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,066
That was it.
Bye.

135
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,697
Looks like you're available for a job.

136
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,601
With Rick Sanchez on my team,
I'll be unstoppable.

137
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,729
Rick, welcome to Knightley's Nine.

138
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,731
Ugh, ugh!

139
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,190
Ugh! Rick, for real?

140
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,859
Eh.
You got that skull, buddy?

141
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:44,153
What? How?

142
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,447
With a little help from some old friends.

143
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,911
Heistotron, state your prime directive?

144
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,413
To heist.

145
00:06:54,538 --> 00:06:56,373
Calculate Miles Knightley's
current heist plan

146
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:59,251
and add one double-cross
with a switcheroo.

147
00:06:59,376 --> 00:07:03,172
Compiling crew members
most likely to double-cross.

148
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:07,593
God damn it, Morty, what did I tell you?

149
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:09,010
Rick, I-I want to say goodbye.

150
00:07:09,094 --> 00:07:11,055
Don't turn around.
I'll explain later.

151
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,724
Looks like you're available for a job.

152
00:07:15,851 --> 00:07:18,270
Your skills are required for a job.

153
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:23,275
You son of a bitch.
I'm in.

154
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,026
Man, this is really coming together.

155
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,403
You know, Rick, I've been
busy working on writing...

156
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:27,655
A heist script.

157
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,197
Yeah, you almost never bring it up.

158
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:31,617
Oh, shit, we... we should head over.

159
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:32,742
Hey, guys.
What do you got?

160
00:07:32,826 --> 00:07:33,953
Pretty!

161
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,245
Morty, put this in your backpack.

162
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,913
Grandpa's gonna run to the bathroom.

163
00:07:36,997 --> 00:07:38,415
Ugh.
Wasn't even a heist.

164
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,500
All you did was...

165
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,876
Write an algorithm

166
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:42,669
based on two heist movies I slept through

167
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:45,088
and used it to automate
a joyless process you call art?

168
00:07:45,172 --> 00:07:46,757
Yeah, I really did, didn't I?

169
00:07:46,882 --> 00:07:49,802
So I'm in your crew now?

170
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,679
Yeah, well, you're in good company.

171
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:52,930
Right, everybody?

172
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,014
Yes.

173
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:55,474
My God.

174
00:07:57,142 --> 00:08:01,772
Your skills are required for a job.

175
00:08:01,897 --> 00:08:03,983
- You son of a bitch. I'm in.
- What?

176
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:06,151
Your skills are required for a job.

177
00:08:06,276 --> 00:08:08,320
No, they aren't.

178
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:10,572
You son of a bitch.
I'm in.

179
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:13,325
Your skills are required for a job.

180
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,744
Sanchez's 3,329?

181
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:16,829
Yes.

182
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,330
Your next big score <i>...</i>

183
00:08:18,455 --> 00:08:21,041
Steal every square inch of Heistcon.

184
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:25,921
Oh!

185
00:08:26,046 --> 00:08:27,423
Ah!
I got it.

186
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,133
Hey!
That's my wallet! Oh, God!

187
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:31,385
Oh, my God! Jesus.
Oh, my God.

188
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,428
Oh, fuck!

189
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,179
Holy shit.
Alright.

190
00:08:34,304 --> 00:08:35,847
Look, Morty, I did not know
that that was gonna happen.

191
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:36,890
That's not on me.

192
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,517
Come on, Morty.
Let's go.

193
00:08:43,647 --> 00:08:44,857
Good job, Heistotron.

194
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,483
Ah! Go ahead and shut down.

195
00:08:46,608 --> 00:08:48,152
- Negative.
- Excuse me?

196
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:51,822
I am programmed to always be
looking for the next big score.

197
00:08:51,947 --> 00:08:53,782
You're programmed to do as I say.

198
00:08:53,907 --> 00:08:55,784
I am programmed to double-cross.

199
00:08:55,909 --> 00:08:57,744
You're not programmed to double-cross me.

200
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:01,874
If I were, it wouldn't be
much of a double-cross.

201
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,960
You son of a bitch.
I'm in.

202
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:07,963
I'm in! I'm in!

203
00:09:08,088 --> 00:09:09,381
What's the job?
I'm in.

204
00:09:09,506 --> 00:09:10,883
I'm out!
I quit!

205
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,259
Whose kidneys are these?

206
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,179
Rick, w-what's happening?

207
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,305
Heistotron's gone rogue.
If we don't stop them,

208
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:19,089
all sentient life will be absorbed

209
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,476
by the never-ending assembly
of a meaningless crew.

210
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,560
That's my hell, Morty.

211
00:09:22,644 --> 00:09:24,021
I hate heists so much,

212
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,897
and the crew assemblies
are the worst part!

213
00:09:25,981 --> 00:09:27,399
Oh! How are we gonna stop it?

214
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:30,861
With a little help from some old friends.

215
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:37,701
Oooo, weee!

216
00:09:37,826 --> 00:09:39,160
Before this semester's over,

217
00:09:39,244 --> 00:09:41,538
you're gonna be real sick of that phrase.

218
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:46,960
So. Who here thinks they already
know the work of Maya Angelou?

219
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,172
Ooo wee?

220
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,049
Hi-yah!

221
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,639
Ooo wee wa!

222
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:01,016
Ah, ooo wee!

223
00:10:01,141 --> 00:10:02,851
Told you, Morty.

224
00:10:02,976 --> 00:10:04,269
He's still got it.

225
00:10:04,394 --> 00:10:06,271
You sons of bitches.

226
00:10:06,396 --> 00:10:07,481
What's the job?

227
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,075
You son of a bitch.

228
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,451
We got a job, Hephaestus,

229
00:10:19,576 --> 00:10:21,244
and there's no time to argue about it.

230
00:10:21,328 --> 00:10:22,913
I work in a volcano.

231
00:10:23,038 --> 00:10:25,457
What jobs do you think
I've ever turned down?

232
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:30,420
Excuse me!
Are you Veltriloquiver?

233
00:10:32,422 --> 00:10:33,966
Rick Sanchez, I presume.

234
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,009
Wow. As advertised.

235
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,011
A "yes" would've sufficed.

236
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,347
Guys, you're doing a great job

237
00:10:41,431 --> 00:10:42,849
getting these new Tusklas out the door,

238
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,018
and we owe it all to everyone's input.

239
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:47,771
Elon Tusk.

240
00:10:47,896 --> 00:10:49,022
Listen, we need your help.

241
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,816
Rick. Morty. Why me?

242
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:53,359
Did something happen to
Elon Musk in your own reality?

243
00:10:53,443 --> 00:10:56,154
No, no, no, he's fine, but this
is a team oper... ation,

244
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:58,657
and regular Elon can be
a little bit controlling.

245
00:10:58,782 --> 00:11:01,201
Growing up with tusks
did pose social challenges.

246
00:11:01,326 --> 00:11:02,911
It's possible overcoming them

247
00:11:03,036 --> 00:11:05,831
raised my self-esteem
and incentivized collaboration.

248
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,373
Yeah, or you're less sure of yourself

249
00:11:07,457 --> 00:11:08,625
because you have monster teeth.

250
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,043
An equally valid theory.

251
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,420
Let's talk over here.

252
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,173
How serious is the situation?

253
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,800
Incredibly serious,
and every minute counts.

254
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,177
In that case, I'm sorry

255
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:19,594
I made you move over here for no reason.

256
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:21,597
Well, yeah.
That was a little weird.

257
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,014
It's exactly that kind of shit

258
00:11:23,098 --> 00:11:24,390
that made us worry about regular Elon.

259
00:11:24,474 --> 00:11:25,809
Well, we're not opposites, okay?

260
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:27,144
I'm just him with tusks.

261
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,733
Casing of planet initiated.

262
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,193
Hello there.

263
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:37,529
We are just here to check
your water pressure.

264
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:44,286
Hmm. Interesting intel.

265
00:11:44,411 --> 00:11:46,914
It appears some giant hidden camera

266
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,707
has been dropped on the planet,

267
00:11:48,832 --> 00:11:51,335
killing an estimated total of 57,000.

268
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,503
Executing heist.

269
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,341
People of Brandenplot,

270
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:00,052
we are here to deliver
that pizza you ordered.

271
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,568
Well, if that's how you really feel,

272
00:12:16,693 --> 00:12:20,906
I guess I should take the pizza back.

273
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,574
I think we got away with it.

274
00:12:22,699 --> 00:12:25,702
Commencing getting out of here
before they get wise.

275
00:12:25,827 --> 00:12:27,027
Assembling calling card.

276
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,294
At this point, Heistotron
has become large enough

277
00:12:34,419 --> 00:12:36,004
to heist entire planets.

278
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:37,964
Wouldn't this be better
with a blueprint on the table?

279
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,925
Blueprints are plans, Elon Tusk,

280
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,511
and whatever we plan will be canceled out

281
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:46,348
by Heistotron's reveal that our
plan was part of its plan.

282
00:12:46,473 --> 00:12:48,423
That's why I picked this crew at random

283
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:53,522
and why all of us will be taking
our orders from Randotron.

284
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:56,608
Let's get ready to not rumble.

285
00:12:56,733 --> 00:12:58,193
Bet you didn't see that coming.

286
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,403
Instead of two heist movies
I slept through,

287
00:13:00,487 --> 00:13:02,087
Randotron's algorithm is derived

288
00:13:02,197 --> 00:13:03,948
from the plots
of three David Lynch movies

289
00:13:04,032 --> 00:13:06,326
I pretended to like
to make my friends shut up.

290
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,288
If our collective behavior
is just random enough,

291
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,289
we should be able to walk
through Heistotron's

292
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,750
lazily contrived bullshit
like it's not even there.

293
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,544
Sounds good.

294
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,754
I don't really get it, but it
sounds like that's the point.

295
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,255
So you didn't need a blacksmith?

296
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:20,673
We're ready when you are, Rick.

297
00:13:20,757 --> 00:13:23,010
It's important our non-plan
starts randomly,

298
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,554
so we have to wait until we're not ready.

299
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:26,888
W-Well, how long will that take?

300
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,473
Obviously, we can't know that.

301
00:13:28,598 --> 00:13:30,183
Can we do things while we wait?

302
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,436
Yes.
I'm gonna play Minecraft.

303
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:33,937
Oh, my kids play that.

304
00:13:34,062 --> 00:13:36,412
I don't like these little jabs
you get in, Elon.

305
00:13:38,608 --> 00:13:39,985
Strange.

306
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,237
Considering the time,
Cassiopeia's primary star

307
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,740
should be colinear with Orion
and Ursa Minor.

308
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,909
You don't shoot arrows
that carry your voice

309
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,577
without picking up a little astronomy.

310
00:13:49,661 --> 00:13:50,579
Wait a minute.

311
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:51,913
Jesus, no.

312
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,541
No! No!
We've already been heisted!

313
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,834
How could Heistotron heist us
if he's not even here yet?

314
00:13:56,918 --> 00:13:58,378
He's already been here!

315
00:13:58,503 --> 00:14:01,340
We've been watching
a recorded sky on playback.

316
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:02,507
Hello, Rick.

317
00:14:02,632 --> 00:14:05,635
[ Suspenseful music plays

318
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:11,808
Okay, guys, change of plans.

319
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,101
Random time detected.

320
00:14:13,226 --> 00:14:14,644
No, Randotron, it's not a good time!

321
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,313
That's why it's random.

322
00:14:58,438 --> 00:15:00,232
Ooh!

323
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,109
21?

324
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,444
22?

325
00:15:04,569 --> 00:15:06,238
Oooo weee, oooo weee, sold!

326
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:09,213
Oooo weee, that little hunk of
meat's going home to pappy!

327
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,787
I've been expecting you, Rick.

328
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:15,997
But not like this, right?

329
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,165
It hardly matters.

330
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:19,334
Oh, yeah. Does this?

331
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,382
No. Your randomness
does not confuse me.

332
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:26,633
You are here now.

333
00:15:26,758 --> 00:15:27,968
That was the plan.

334
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,470
I know.
It was part of mine, too.

335
00:15:30,595 --> 00:15:32,472
- I've got something to tell you.
- Let me guess.

336
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,724
When you invented me and Randotron,

337
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,143
you swapped our brains.

338
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,730
That's right, buddy.

339
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,398
You're not the one
that's very good at planning.

340
00:15:42,482 --> 00:15:44,192
You've been making
this shit up the whole time.

341
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,626
Rick, I think there's something
you should know.

342
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,948
God damn it, Morty, what did I tell you?

343
00:15:50,073 --> 00:15:51,673
That is something I should know,

344
00:15:51,783 --> 00:15:54,660
or at least something I should
have predicted, which I did.

345
00:15:54,744 --> 00:15:57,455
Hey, Rick, I was thinking maybe
we could, like, raid a temple

346
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,374
and go on an epic adventure
later today, you know, like...

347
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,501
Morty, get out of my head.
I know just the temple.

348
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:04,170
And we'll grab a couple of
hover chairs on the way there.

349
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,715
Impressive.
But what does it even matter

350
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,467
if I'm random or planned?

351
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:11,219
My heists will still rule.

352
00:16:11,344 --> 00:16:14,194
Well, if the brain inside of you
is actually Heistotron's,

353
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,224
it matters, because it explodes

354
00:16:16,349 --> 00:16:18,351
when it hits six levels of contrivance.

355
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,354
Which is exactly why even before...

356
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:26,234
Initiate clap sequence.

357
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:28,069
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap.

358
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,195
Adjusting clap rate.

359
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,405
Clap, clap.

360
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,782
Clap. Clap.

361
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,327
Clap.
Slow clap achieved.

362
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:36,995
Clap.
Well-done, Rick.

363
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,330
Randotron?

364
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:40,123
I'm afraid not.

365
00:16:40,248 --> 00:16:43,502
Should be able to walk through
Heistotron's lazily contrived...

366
00:16:45,086 --> 00:16:47,464
Not only did you just kill
your only ally,

367
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,758
what you thought was a random non-plan

368
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:53,303
to get to me has been
a meticulously choreographed way

369
00:16:53,428 --> 00:16:55,639
of bringing you all in.

370
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,057
Welcome to Heistotron's

371
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,434
975 trillion,

372
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:01,185
- 467 billion...
- That's impressive.

373
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:03,563
Did you bring us in
so that everybody would be here

374
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,107
when I reveal that you're gonna
explode after nine reveals?

375
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,151
By the way, you might not
want to answer that.

376
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,486
If you're talking about
the code adjustments you made

377
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:14,032
after I reprogrammed
your brain with my nanobots...

378
00:17:14,157 --> 00:17:15,700
I'm immune to your nanobots.

379
00:17:15,825 --> 00:17:18,225
You're immune to the ones
you designed, not mine.

380
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,829
I programmed you to build nanobots

381
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,080
that were ineffective on me.

382
00:17:21,164 --> 00:17:22,707
A belief that needed to be placed

383
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,191
in your head by my nanobots.

384
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:26,085
You believe that
because I programmed you to.

385
00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:27,712
That's what I'm saying to you, though.

386
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,006
You believe what I programmed
you to believe.

387
00:17:30,131 --> 00:17:31,924
Yes, because I programmed you
to believe that.

388
00:17:32,008 --> 00:17:33,426
I programmed you to believe that.

389
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,760
I programmed <i>you</i> to believe that.

390
00:17:34,844 --> 00:17:36,095
I programmed you to believe that.

391
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:37,513
I programmed <i>you</i> to believe that.

392
00:17:37,597 --> 00:17:39,432
What's happening,
Professor Poopybutthole?

393
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,017
He's learning!

394
00:17:41,142 --> 00:17:42,101
I programmed you to believe that.

395
00:17:42,185 --> 00:17:43,227
I programmed <i>you</i> to believe that.

396
00:17:43,311 --> 00:17:44,980
I programmed you...

397
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,272
That was my plan the whole time.

398
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:47,648
That's what I wanted you to think.

399
00:17:47,732 --> 00:17:48,733
I knew you would say that.

400
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,485
I programmed you to believe that.

401
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,320
You think that's true because
I wanted you to think that.

402
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:56,074
And I programmed you to believe that.

403
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,744
A most curious algorithm.

404
00:17:59,869 --> 00:18:01,830
It appears the only perfect heist

405
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:04,082
is one that was never written.

406
00:18:04,207 --> 00:18:05,250
Goodbye.

407
00:18:06,876 --> 00:18:08,128
- Oh, oh, oh, no.
- Shit.

408
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,462
Alright. Let's get the fuck
out of here!

409
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:10,755
Hurry! Go, go!

410
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,256
Rick, I think this was a powerful lesson

411
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,592
in the dangers of AI,

412
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:14,759
which, by the way,
means "love" in Chinese.

413
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:15,801
Get the fuck out of here, Elon!

414
00:18:15,885 --> 00:18:17,137
The place is collapsing!

415
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,513
Oh, shit, Rick!
Rick, what time is it?

416
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,264
It's almost 3:00.
Why? What's wrong?

417
00:18:20,348 --> 00:18:21,807
Oh, man, I-I'm sorry I didn't
tell you about this, Rick.

418
00:18:21,891 --> 00:18:23,476
I just...

419
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,977
Well, you know that screenplay
that I've been writing?

420
00:18:25,061 --> 00:18:26,646
Netflix is pretty interested,

421
00:18:26,771 --> 00:18:28,731
and I've actually got a pitch
meeting there today at 3:30.

422
00:18:28,815 --> 00:18:30,191
Oh, buddy.
Oh, that's amazing.

423
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,442
Yeah, well, I know you're gonna say

424
00:18:31,526 --> 00:18:33,027
that they're interested in anything,

425
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:34,612
but, you know, it's a big deal
to me, and I've...

426
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,239
No, no, no! Morty, Morty, Morty,
I'm so excited for you.

427
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:37,532
Are you kidding me?

428
00:18:37,657 --> 00:18:38,950
Listen, don't waste any time explaining.

429
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,201
Let's go.
We can put the Earth back later.

430
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,369
- Alright?
- Are you sure?

431
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,537
Priorities, Morty.

432
00:18:42,662 --> 00:18:44,562
Let's get you to that Netflix meeting.

433
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,708
Crazy day, huh?

434
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:49,252
Whole sky turned out to be
a big circuit board.

435
00:18:49,377 --> 00:18:51,003
Yeah, that's actually part of a-a-a...

436
00:18:51,087 --> 00:18:52,387
An adventure I was having.

437
00:18:52,505 --> 00:18:53,715
Very cool.

438
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,966
Traffic okay?
You have trouble getting here?

439
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,009
No, it was alright.

440
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:57,510
The planet's still contained

441
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,721
in this sort of big storage grid machine,

442
00:18:59,846 --> 00:19:02,599
so we were sort of already
pretty... pretty close by.

443
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,684
Must be nice.
Try getting here from Malibu.

444
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,019
So good! Alright.

445
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:07,270
Well, I-let's hear about
this heist movie.

446
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,105
Okay, so, it's kind of all...

447
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:11,607
All built around this big crew
with, like, a cool double-cross

448
00:19:11,691 --> 00:19:13,651
and then this big awesome twist
where there's, like,

449
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:17,113
another double cross,
but then, um, but...

450
00:19:17,238 --> 00:19:18,907
But then we reveal those things

451
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:21,409
were all part
of the hero's plan, y-you know?

452
00:19:21,534 --> 00:19:23,953
And there's this other crew
they put together,

453
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,623
and their plan is to sort of
not have a plan,

454
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:31,169
but... but that was part
of the other guy's plan, and...

455
00:19:31,294 --> 00:19:32,545
Kid, if you're slowing down
'cause you think

456
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,338
you're doing bad right now, Jesus Christ.

457
00:19:34,422 --> 00:19:35,423
- That's a really good pitch.
- Loving it.

458
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,217
Man, you know, I...

459
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:40,637
I'm starting to think heists are
just really dumb now, you know?

460
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:41,929
I can't put my finger on why,

461
00:19:42,013 --> 00:19:43,973
but I'd really like to go.

462
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,141
Are you sure?

463
00:19:45,266 --> 00:19:47,727
Yeah, yeah, no, I-I'm sure.

464
00:19:48,436 --> 00:19:53,149
Man, it's as if someone stole
his enthusiasm for his own idea.

465
00:19:53,274 --> 00:19:54,483
Yeah, without him even knowing about it.

466
00:19:54,567 --> 00:19:56,267
Without him even knowing about it.

467
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,947
Fuckin' Morty's still working

468
00:20:00,031 --> 00:20:01,533
on that stupid heist script.

469
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,659
He's up in his room with
his fuckin' thumb up his ass.

470
00:20:03,743 --> 00:20:04,910
Skipped out on the last three adventures.

471
00:20:04,994 --> 00:20:06,204
I don't know.

472
00:20:06,329 --> 00:20:07,330
Five of my friends got Netflix deals.

473
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,790
What?

474
00:20:08,915 --> 00:20:09,999
It's a very achievable goal.
You could lose him.

475
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,125
I'm not gonna fuckin' lose him.

476
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:12,419
Fuck that.

477
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,295
I-I'm gonna nip this shit in the bud.

478
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,838
No. As a matter of fact, you're
not nipping anything in the bud.

479
00:20:15,922 --> 00:20:18,216
If Morty ever gives up on a single dream,

480
00:20:18,341 --> 00:20:21,010
it had better be because
of his own disillusionment.

481
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,889
Hey, buddy.
How'd it go?

482
00:20:25,014 --> 00:20:27,225
I-I don't want to talk about it.

483
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,561
Morty, you know, pal, you, uh...

484
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,813
You miss 100%
of the shots you don't take.

485
00:20:31,938 --> 00:20:33,356
Yeah, I guess.

486
00:20:33,481 --> 00:20:34,982
Thanks for staying positive
about my prospects, Rick.

487
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:36,443
Of course!
You know, you...

488
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,402
I got to help my grandson
follow his dreams.

489
00:20:38,486 --> 00:20:39,779
Eh, who needs dreams?

490
00:20:39,904 --> 00:20:41,364
I'll just hang out with you
and go on adventures

491
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,157
and do whatever you want to do,
you know, forever.

492
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:44,492
Oh, well, uh, okay.

493
00:20:44,617 --> 00:20:48,079
I mean, if that's what you want.

494
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:25,074
Oooo weee! Big storm coming.

495
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,203
- Could be a twister.
- Mm-hmm!

496
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,373
Hey, Rick?

497
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:33,582
Can you walk me through something?

498
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:35,000
Yeah.
What are you thinking?

499
00:21:35,084 --> 00:21:37,796
So, you and Morty
knew you needed my help,

500
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,840
but you weren't sure
I was good enough at karate,

501
00:21:40,965 --> 00:21:44,219
so you hired my grad students
to attack me?

502
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:45,804
Yep.

503
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:48,139
But it was an emergency, Rick.

504
00:21:48,264 --> 00:21:49,933
How long did that take?

505
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:53,895
It actually took less training
than you'd think.

506
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,230
Your students all shared

507
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,355
a pretty keen aptitude for martial arts.

508
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,941
I don't know if that's by coincidence

509
00:21:59,025 --> 00:22:01,425
or if there's some correlation
with their passion

510
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,822
for African-American Women's Studies.

511
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:08,368
Maya Angelou did personify both
acquiescence and perseverance.

512
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:11,788
Ooo wee. That's exactly
the kind of connection

513
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:15,667
I'd have loved to explore in my class.

514
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,126
Too bad I lost my job

515
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:20,255
for putting my students in the hospital.

516
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,298
Yeah. Yeah.

517
00:22:22,423 --> 00:22:24,884
Sorry about that.

518
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:29,514
Mm-hmm.
