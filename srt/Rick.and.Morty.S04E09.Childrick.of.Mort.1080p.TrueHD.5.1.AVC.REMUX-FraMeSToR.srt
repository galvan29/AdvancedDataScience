1
00:00:01,542 --> 00:00:04,128
What kind of parents drag their kids away

2
00:00:04,253 --> 00:00:05,796
for the entire week of spring break?

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,673
I'm missing Mike Triscuit's drug party.

4
00:00:07,757 --> 00:00:09,341
Look at this.
He's already watching

5
00:00:09,425 --> 00:00:10,467
"Euphoria" to pregame.

6
00:00:10,551 --> 00:00:12,970
Pregame. Game.
Video game.

7
00:00:13,095 --> 00:00:16,057
Yes, yes, drugs and video games.
Poor babies.

8
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:19,894
What you need is to level up
with a bong rip of nature.

9
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:21,569
Trust me, this is good for you.

10
00:00:21,687 --> 00:00:23,648
Can someone just kill me?

11
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:25,149
Grandpa Rick, you can kill anything.

12
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:27,693
No, he can't, Summer.
We're roughing it.

13
00:00:27,818 --> 00:00:29,361
And that means no sci-fi bullshit.

14
00:00:29,445 --> 00:00:31,145
- Isn't that right, Rick?
- Uh-huh.

15
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:37,161
Rick, was that a sci-fi phone call?

16
00:00:37,286 --> 00:00:38,663
Shut up, Jerry.

17
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:40,831
Damn it, I didn't think
she had this number.

18
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:43,292
Why are you building a Faraday
box to block out the signal?

19
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:44,835
Oh, my God, Grandpa's ghosting someone.

20
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:46,753
I'm not ghosting.
Hey! Give it back, Summer!

21
00:00:46,837 --> 00:00:48,256
"Rick.
Please answer me.

22
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,590
I'm pregnant"?!

23
00:00:49,715 --> 00:00:52,552
Oh, my God, Grandpa, you fuck boi.

24
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:54,053
I'm not a fuck boi Summer!

25
00:00:54,178 --> 00:00:55,928
There's no way those kids are mine.

26
00:00:56,013 --> 00:00:58,348
Wow. At least we know why Rick
actually came on the trip <i>...</i>

27
00:00:58,432 --> 00:00:59,808
To avoid his fuck-guy problems.

28
00:00:59,892 --> 00:01:01,602
- Why would this person lie?
- I don't know, honey.

29
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:03,228
She's addicted to what the Rick did.

30
00:01:03,312 --> 00:01:04,730
You know, it's... it's...
It's a tale as old

31
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,148
as my huge dynamite penis.

32
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:07,524
Can we turn the radio on?

33
00:01:07,608 --> 00:01:08,942
I am not letting you abandon those kids

34
00:01:09,026 --> 00:01:10,777
- like you abandoned me.
- Oh, my God!

35
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:12,988
We're going to see
this baby mama right now!

36
00:01:13,072 --> 00:01:14,323
What, like, literally now?

37
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,908
Yes, now!
That's an order.

38
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,537
Aah!

39
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:21,539
No!

40
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,916
This is exactly what I was talking about!

41
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:25,709
Rick, I hope you realize
the tubing permit

42
00:01:25,793 --> 00:01:27,461
was non-refundable!

43
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,213
Relax, Jerry, we'll be
in and out in a minute,

44
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,423
and then you can get right back
to your dumb vacation

45
00:01:31,507 --> 00:01:33,307
with a family that doesn't need you.

46
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,285
Kind of expected someone to defend me,

47
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,888
but, sure, okay.

48
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:41,517
Hello, Gaia.
Hold on.

49
00:01:41,642 --> 00:01:44,228
Let me just adjust my
Seismic-to-English translator.

50
00:01:44,353 --> 00:01:45,980
<i>Rick. You came.</i>

51
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:48,399
- W-Where is she?
- You're looking at her.

52
00:01:48,524 --> 00:01:49,942
I-I-I-I don't understand.

53
00:01:50,067 --> 00:01:51,319
Isn't it obvious, Morty?

54
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,945
I fucked a planet.

55
00:02:24,935 --> 00:02:27,437
So, what, you just go around
knocking up planets now?

56
00:02:27,521 --> 00:02:29,231
I-I-Is that what you do
when I'm at school?

57
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,108
I'm a scientist, Morty.
I try things.

58
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,492
Sex with a living planet?
Big step for mankind.

59
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:36,072
Yeah, we finally broke
the deadbeat dad barrier.

60
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:38,157
- Ah, where the magic happened.
- Gross.

61
00:02:38,282 --> 00:02:41,410
Hey, uh, Gaia, baby,
Big Daddy Rick is here.

62
00:02:41,535 --> 00:02:42,953
- What's the problem?
<i>- Children.</i>

63
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,288
<i>Birth cycle. Now.</i>

64
00:02:44,413 --> 00:02:47,833
Okay, gettin' right into it.

65
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,877
- I am! I am!
- Jesus Christ!

66
00:02:50,002 --> 00:02:52,672
- I am!
- I am!

67
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,507
Dad, do something!
Make it stop!

68
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:55,924
You think I know how to stop this?

69
00:02:56,008 --> 00:02:57,885
I thought she was gonna shit an egg.

70
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,763
Cool vacation, guys.

71
00:03:00,888 --> 00:03:02,222
So happy I got to see the human geyser

72
00:03:02,306 --> 00:03:03,807
instead of micro-dosing with my friends.

73
00:03:03,891 --> 00:03:06,310
<i>More coming. Kids.
Need father.</i>

74
00:03:06,435 --> 00:03:08,687
Yeah, um, Baby Quakes,
how big is your orbit again?

75
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,647
I mean, not to say
you get around, but, um...

76
00:03:10,731 --> 00:03:11,982
Are you kidding me?
Look at them!

77
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,275
They look just like you.

78
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:14,943
Yeah, and snakes look like dildos, Beth.

79
00:03:15,027 --> 00:03:16,194
- What's your point?
- They do?

80
00:03:16,278 --> 00:03:17,779
The fact is even if they were mine,

81
00:03:17,863 --> 00:03:20,282
which they're not,
the best parent is evolution.

82
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:23,243
They'll probably develop harder
skin or maybe even webbed arms.

83
00:03:23,327 --> 00:03:25,370
Man, that'd be cool, huh?
Flying squirrel people?

84
00:03:25,454 --> 00:03:27,664
Yeah, Dad, that approach
worked out great for me.

85
00:03:27,748 --> 00:03:29,124
Beth, I know it looks bad, but trust me.

86
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,542
This is life in the galaxy, okay?

87
00:03:30,626 --> 00:03:31,711
It's totally normal.

88
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:35,506
Fine.
You won't do something, I will.

89
00:03:35,631 --> 00:03:37,299
Welp, there goes the surprise!

90
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,092
I was gonna have us jump
on the trampoline

91
00:03:39,176 --> 00:03:40,385
- after we caught our first fish.
- I am!

92
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:42,471
- What? You're stupid.
- I am!

93
00:03:42,596 --> 00:03:44,222
- I am! I am!
- Beth, that's not gonna help.

94
00:03:44,306 --> 00:03:45,766
Uh, I hate to agree with Rick,

95
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,100
but shouldn't we just let this be?

96
00:03:47,184 --> 00:03:48,393
We're supposed to be on vacation.

97
00:03:48,477 --> 00:03:49,645
You're unemployed, Jerry!

98
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,271
Every day is a vacation for you.

99
00:03:51,355 --> 00:03:52,981
- Okay, ouch.
- You guys do whatever you want.

100
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:54,483
I'm staying here and fixing this.

101
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,152
- I am!
- I am!

102
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,527
Goddamn it, Beth, if you're gonna do it,

103
00:03:57,611 --> 00:03:59,113
at least do it right.

104
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:01,198
Gaia, baby, gonna need
a little raw iron and steam.

105
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,659
<i>Whatever you need, baby.</i>

106
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,668
- So much for camping.
- Nope.

107
00:04:12,793 --> 00:04:14,170
We are going camping.

108
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:16,463
There's trees over there.
We're on solid ground.

109
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:17,715
- Mom!
- Summer, Morty,

110
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,090
go camp with your father.

111
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,717
- Ohh, son of a bitch.
- Son of a bitch.

112
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:22,052
- I am!
- I am!

113
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:24,513
Welp, welcome to lack of abandonment.

114
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,690
Dad, can we please go back

115
00:04:27,808 --> 00:04:29,267
and hang out with Grandpa's clay people?

116
00:04:29,351 --> 00:04:31,979
Why? Because they might
have a Sega Dreamcast?

117
00:04:32,104 --> 00:04:34,314
Why is it so hard for you two
to let nature in?

118
00:04:34,398 --> 00:04:36,358
Because this sucks ass.
Camping is just

119
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,026
being homeless without the change.

120
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,237
Well, that attitude is
exactly why we're out here.

121
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,322
You guys wouldn't last
two seconds on your own.

122
00:04:42,406 --> 00:04:44,074
You're only happy when you're penned in

123
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:47,119
and drugged up like
some kind of chicken or lemur.

124
00:04:47,244 --> 00:04:49,205
Hey!
I told you kids no phones!

125
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,706
There's not even any service.

126
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,332
Just... Just let us
be happy for a minute.

127
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,459
You know, maybe if you
two stopped whining

128
00:04:54,543 --> 00:04:56,253
and let your old man take the reins,

129
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:59,298
you might actually learn something.

130
00:04:59,423 --> 00:05:01,550
Here.
Take a bite of this tasty treat.

131
00:05:01,675 --> 00:05:04,011
Oh, you think this s'more
makes you special?

132
00:05:04,136 --> 00:05:05,929
What? Because someone said,
"good job,"

133
00:05:06,013 --> 00:05:07,389
to you once when you were 10?

134
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,892
That's actually really sad, dad.
Let's be real.

135
00:05:10,017 --> 00:05:11,518
You've been high-roading us non-stop,

136
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,103
forcing us to do nothing
in the middle of fucking nowhere

137
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:14,563
because it's the only way

138
00:05:14,688 --> 00:05:15,897
you're gonna level
the playing field, isn't it?

139
00:05:15,981 --> 00:05:17,983
Because if you move the bar so low,

140
00:05:18,108 --> 00:05:20,653
you might actually seem like
you're worth a fuck.

141
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,571
Huh.

142
00:05:22,696 --> 00:05:24,865
I'm gonna go take a walk.

143
00:05:29,036 --> 00:05:30,704
Jesus Christ.
You really need to stop

144
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,081
hanging out with Rick.

145
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,712
Okay, so, if we divert
the Lawyer Pipeline here,

146
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,172
they should avoid the Ethics Tube

147
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:41,757
and come out spineless enough
to do their job.

148
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,509
Right.
Wait, why are the athletes

149
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,093
going through the introvert sector?

150
00:05:45,177 --> 00:05:46,887
Obviously so they can bully
the mathematicians

151
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:49,556
- and give us astronomers.
- God, you are such a space nerd.

152
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,725
I'm not a nerd. We're raising
a society here, Beth.

153
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,185
If we want them to be self-sufficient,

154
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,561
they need to get out into space.

155
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,814
<i>Birth cycle. Coming.</i>

156
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:59,589
We got you, Gai-Gai! Shoot 'em
hard and up the middle!

157
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,624
We got an oversupply of teachers

158
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:17,167
putting a strain on the literary drive.

159
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,710
Activating playwright converter!

160
00:06:18,794 --> 00:06:20,504
Aah!

161
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:22,255
Nice work, honey.
Okay, the therapists

162
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:23,799
are getting bored.
We need to increase

163
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,884
- their supply of incest porn.
- 20% wasn't enough?

164
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,219
What the hell is that?

165
00:06:27,344 --> 00:06:28,804
The unproductives.
Goddamn it!

166
00:06:28,929 --> 00:06:30,764
- How are there so many of them?
- Unproductives?

167
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,808
Yeah, deejays, foodies, influencers.

168
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:34,983
I just re-circulate them through until...

169
00:06:36,103 --> 00:06:37,896
Shit, they blew a hole in
the human resources department!

170
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,980
- You're fired!
- Downsizing already?

171
00:06:39,064 --> 00:06:40,564
I'm putting this in your file!

172
00:06:42,651 --> 00:06:43,819
We gotta fix this, Dad.

173
00:06:43,944 --> 00:06:45,529
We can't keep recycling them through.

174
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,197
I could add an online college workaround.

175
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:49,199
Or just push them out
through a pipe in the back.

176
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,826
- Same thing.
- Same thing.

177
00:06:50,951 --> 00:06:53,245
These kids may not be mine,
but you definitely are.

178
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,497
Look at you.
My little steampunk overlord.

179
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:56,665
Eeee!

180
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,084
I don't think he's coming back.

181
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:00,752
You know, you... you really
messed him up, Summer.

182
00:07:00,836 --> 00:07:02,254
Yeah, well, he called me a lemur.

183
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:03,588
Let's just go find grandpa.

184
00:07:03,672 --> 00:07:05,215
Maybe he can portal us home or something.

185
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,050
- Should we leave a note?
- Dad is fine.

186
00:07:07,134 --> 00:07:08,510
He's probably sucking off a tree

187
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,644
and having the time
of his life right now.

188
00:07:12,556 --> 00:07:15,267
Guess you don't want to learn
how to skip rocks, either.

189
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,644
Aah!

190
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,813
Aaah!

191
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,106
Whoa! Whoa!

192
00:07:21,231 --> 00:07:24,151
Aah! Aaaaaah!

193
00:07:24,276 --> 00:07:25,569
Ohh!

194
00:07:25,694 --> 00:07:27,488
Aaaaaah!

195
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,906
Gah!

196
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,407
Ohhhh!

197
00:07:30,532 --> 00:07:32,284
Aaah!

198
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:36,121
Aah!

199
00:07:36,246 --> 00:07:38,958
Aah!

200
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:47,633
Aaah!

201
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:48,968
Ow! Hey!

202
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:50,844
Aah!

203
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,222
Aaaaah!

204
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:57,768
Aaaaaaaah!

205
00:07:57,893 --> 00:07:59,395
Ohh!

206
00:08:04,566 --> 00:08:05,734
Who are you guys?

207
00:08:05,859 --> 00:08:09,113
We are...
unproductives.

208
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,031
Ahh, I get it.

209
00:08:11,156 --> 00:08:12,950
Bunch of bullshit.

210
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,372
What is that?

211
00:08:18,497 --> 00:08:21,417
This?
This is camping.

212
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,293
Camping?
Ooh!

213
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:24,795
Camping!

Good work there, TikTok.

Keep whittling.
Incredible.

226
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,330
You've almost got smoke
over there, Florflock.

227
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,792
There you go, guys!

228
00:09:03,917 --> 00:09:04,960
Pump those cheeks.

229
00:09:05,085 --> 00:09:06,670
That's the camping spirit.

230
00:09:06,795 --> 00:09:08,213
What the... Squeeb!

231
00:09:08,338 --> 00:09:09,673
This is not a tent.

232
00:09:09,798 --> 00:09:11,592
It is a new kind of tent,

233
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,970
with special gutters
to funnel the rain, and a door.

234
00:09:15,095 --> 00:09:17,306
It's a house! No houses!

235
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,975
No doors! Once you have doors,
you have indoors.

236
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,479
Once you have indoors,
you won't want to camp anymore.

237
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:26,690
Then why do they not camp?

238
00:09:26,815 --> 00:09:28,358
Because they're bad.

239
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:30,486
Bad. Bad. Bad.

240
00:09:32,654 --> 00:09:34,656
Oh, my God.
Maybe Dad was right.

241
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,283
Maybe we have no life skills.

242
00:09:36,408 --> 00:09:38,368
I've definitely drank more pee
than I care to remember.

243
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:39,995
I'm just gonna sit down.

244
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,623
If I die, don't eat my ass.
That'd be weird.

245
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,500
Uh, Summer?

246
00:09:48,712 --> 00:09:50,255
Damn, you think they got infected

247
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,739
by a mind slug or something?

248
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,258
Probably drove through a nebula
that made them

249
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,968
see their own fears.

250
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,766
Whoa!
These controls.

251
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:02,976
It's just like my video game controllers.

252
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,687
I just wish I could read these symbols.

253
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:11,527
This looks just like Tricia's bong.

254
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,486
Morty, I think these tubes might contain

255
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,489
all of their collective knowledge.

256
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:23,038
- Mm!
- Well?

257
00:10:23,163 --> 00:10:24,832
I think we got this, bro.

258
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,709
Beth, you wanna do the honors?

259
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:28,961
What? Really? Wow.

260
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:32,172
Okay.
Here we go.

261
00:10:32,297 --> 00:10:34,466
If you told me six days ago
I'd be christening

262
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,760
a generation ship for
my half-rock children,

263
00:10:36,885 --> 00:10:38,345
I would've called you crazy.

264
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,472
But I guess that's the lesson...
Crazy things happen

265
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:43,183
when you put in the work.
Salud!

266
00:10:43,308 --> 00:10:45,477
Fucking Doopnar!
Sing something!

267
00:10:45,602 --> 00:10:47,938
Great toast, Dad.

268
00:10:48,063 --> 00:10:50,463
- Thanks, sweetie.
- Damn, listen to those pipes.

269
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,109
You sure these kids are yours?

270
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,860
What, you've never heard me sing karaoke?

271
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,779
I'm... I'm pretty good when
someone's in my register,

272
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,530
like the guy that sings
"Circle of Life."

273
00:10:57,614 --> 00:10:59,449
Can't remember his name.
Dresses up weird.

274
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:02,369
Look at this.
Everyone's happy.

275
00:11:02,494 --> 00:11:04,121
They're about to go into space.

276
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:06,289
I know things haven't always
been great with us,

277
00:11:06,373 --> 00:11:08,584
but we do make a pretty good team.

278
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,794
<i>Uh, Rick?
Can we talk?</i>

279
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:12,587
Kinda in the middle of
a breakthrough with my daughter.

280
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,821
Go ahead, Dad.
Gaia deserves some time, too.

281
00:11:14,923 --> 00:11:18,552
- They're your kids.
<i>- Yes, about that.</i>

282
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:22,097
Pam!
It's good to see you, baby!

283
00:11:22,222 --> 00:11:24,224
Um, Gaia?
You know this guy?

284
00:11:24,349 --> 00:11:26,268
Ha! You call her Gaia?

285
00:11:26,393 --> 00:11:28,103
- So lame.
- Is that...

286
00:11:28,228 --> 00:11:30,189
- God?
<i>- Rick. The kids.</i>

287
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,816
<i>I messed up.
You're not their father.</i>

288
00:11:32,941 --> 00:11:34,776
Little ones!
Daddy's here!

289
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,778
I'm sending some fog down.

290
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,404
Feel my presence through the fog!

291
00:11:38,488 --> 00:11:39,406
Ooh!

292
00:11:39,531 --> 00:11:41,450
Beth! What the fuck?
Don't touch it!

293
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:44,745
You gotta be kidding me.
God is the father?

294
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,580
No hard feelings, okay?

295
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,289
We thought they were yours, you know,

296
00:11:48,373 --> 00:11:50,209
because they're so small.

297
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,502
Oh, wow. No hard feelings.
Y-You hear that, Beth?

298
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,963
Guy swoops in after we raised
his whole civilization

299
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,841
and tells us he forgives us.
What a fucking mooch!

300
00:11:57,966 --> 00:11:59,676
Don't push me, asshole!

301
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:01,970
<i>Rick, I think you should go.</i>

302
00:12:02,095 --> 00:12:04,389
Seriously? You really want
this pile of dry ice

303
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:05,599
to raise your kids?

304
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,768
Stop acting like you did a good job.

305
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,896
You made my kids soft and empty inside.

306
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:13,065
This city is a monument to nothing!

307
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,483
Where is their faith?

308
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,068
<i>Reggie is right.</i>

309
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:18,028
<i>The children are not ready to leave.</i>

310
00:12:18,153 --> 00:12:19,363
<i>He can give them more.</i>

311
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,364
I mean, maybe we should just bail, Dad.

312
00:12:21,448 --> 00:12:23,783
At least this guy is immortal
and can stick around.

313
00:12:23,867 --> 00:12:25,867
Bullshit. They're my kids!
We're staying!

314
00:12:27,537 --> 00:12:30,081
See? Now, this is the kind
of shit I'm talking about.

315
00:12:30,165 --> 00:12:32,876
Jerry! Oh, my God!

316
00:12:33,001 --> 00:12:34,627
Is that you?
What the hell are you doing?

317
00:12:34,711 --> 00:12:35,671
Camping.

318
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,505
Oh, look, Jerry finally found his people.

319
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:39,382
All it took was a deep enough drip pan.

320
00:12:39,466 --> 00:12:41,969
You labeled these creatures
"unproductive,"

321
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,294
but I have given them
more purpose than ever.

322
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,347
Oh, yeah? They filing your
unemployment forms?

323
00:12:46,431 --> 00:12:48,600
His tongue is sharp,
but it cannot whittle.

324
00:12:48,725 --> 00:12:50,644
The Great Roughing of It is at hand.

325
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:54,189
You will now join the One Family
on its Eternal Getaway.

326
00:12:54,314 --> 00:12:57,734
Or join the embers over which
we hold marshmallows

327
00:12:57,859 --> 00:12:59,403
at just the right distance.

328
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:02,739
Six inches!
Until it gets golden brown!

329
00:13:02,864 --> 00:13:04,574
Don't let it start on fire!

330
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,952
The carbon is bad for you!

331
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:09,955
What's happening?

332
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,416
My children, I give you my power.

333
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,543
Use it to take what is yours.

334
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:17,087
Oh, this motherfucker.
Raise the walls!

335
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,135
Walls can't stop us, Rick.
We are chosen.

336
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,178
Sha-boom-boom!

337
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,680
Sorry! Sorry!

338
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,306
Just trying to get
the hang of this thing.

339
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,517
Nice choice of chosen people, G-diddles.

340
00:13:30,642 --> 00:13:32,518
I guess you'll be playing
the "mysterious ways" card

341
00:13:32,602 --> 00:13:34,270
- on that one.
- You wanna go, bro?

342
00:13:34,354 --> 00:13:37,065
- I'll kick your ass myself.
- Oh, dude, don't tempt me.

343
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,816
When I'm done with you,
you'll need a staff

344
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,360
to un-part your fucking face.

345
00:13:40,485 --> 00:13:43,196
<i>Guys. Please.
Not in front of the kids.</i>

346
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,741
Did you for real just try to smite me?

347
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:49,745
Siri, triangulate source of power.

348
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,454
Got you now, you son of a bitch.

349
00:13:51,538 --> 00:13:52,830
Sweetie, you handle the hippies.

350
00:13:52,914 --> 00:13:54,207
I'll handle the off-brand Yahweh.

351
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,169
- Kick his ass, Dad!
- Bear witness.

352
00:14:02,674 --> 00:14:05,344
Now you see my true form.

353
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:09,181
The clouds were simply a shape
more appealing to Gaia's mind.

354
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:11,391
No shit. Any form is more
appealing than this.

355
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,268
You look like Kid Rock fucked Zeus.

356
00:14:13,393 --> 00:14:15,353
Oh, seriously, you expect me
to fight you like this?

357
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,563
You're the size of
four Empire State Buildings.

358
00:14:17,647 --> 00:14:19,900
Alright, motherfucker.

359
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,694
Let's go.

360
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:40,003
Aaah! Aah!

361
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,714
Ha-ha!
You like that?

362
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,133
- Ohh!
- Here comes some pain!

363
00:14:45,258 --> 00:14:47,886
Ohh!

364
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,109
Ow!

365
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,069
Ow!

366
00:15:07,322 --> 00:15:11,368
And...
that last one should be

367
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,078
the start button.

368
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,603
Perfect.
I guess we're ready.

369
00:15:14,704 --> 00:15:16,665
Let's show Mom and Dad what video games

370
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,792
and partying are all about.

371
00:15:26,591 --> 00:15:28,885
Jesus Christ, was that the wings?

372
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,222
This is not like a video game!

373
00:15:32,347 --> 00:15:34,247
Oh, my God, make it stop!
Make it stop!

374
00:15:34,349 --> 00:15:37,602
- How do I make it stop?!
- I don't know. I'm fucking high!

375
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,688
Aah!

376
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,358
Oh, God, now I'm high, too!

377
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,739
- Jerry, that's enough.
- Oh, hey, babe.

378
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:52,576
You like these plagues
I'm unleashing on your asses?

379
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,577
No, they're lame.
It's not a great sign

380
00:15:54,661 --> 00:15:56,861
that your army's
on the same side as disease.

381
00:15:56,955 --> 00:16:00,167
Sorry we aren't modern enough
to sort people by value

382
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,961
and shit the losers
through a mean butt tube!

383
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:08,216
Just admit this is about you
wanting to feel needed!

384
00:16:08,341 --> 00:16:10,302
Says the woman who sold out her family

385
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,804
for an ounce of approval
from her drunk father!

386
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:14,764
Well, maybe he drinks
because it isn't easy

387
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:17,308
- to be more powerful than God.
- Well, if it's god power

388
00:16:17,392 --> 00:16:19,143
that gets you going, light some candles

389
00:16:19,227 --> 00:16:21,938
and put on the Billy Ocean
because Moses is home

390
00:16:22,063 --> 00:16:24,107
and he's ready to burn some bush!

391
00:16:24,232 --> 00:16:25,984
Sha-boom-boom!

392
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,362
Ohh!
Fuck! Ow!

393
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,072
Alright, alright, stop.

394
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,990
- Come on, bitch!
- Look, you win, okay?

395
00:16:33,074 --> 00:16:34,534
Ju... I don't care about the kids.

396
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,327
Smite them, raise them to fuck sheep.

397
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:37,913
Just keep the city, okay?

398
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:39,288
My daughter and I built that thing.

399
00:16:39,372 --> 00:16:41,875
- It's important to her.
- No, bro. I'm a Zeus.

400
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,127
I can literally do anything.

401
00:16:44,252 --> 00:16:46,838
Think I'm gonna hang around
and raise kids?

402
00:16:46,963 --> 00:16:50,967
The only lesson they need
is right here... fear.

403
00:16:51,092 --> 00:16:53,595
And it looks like school's out, bitch.

404
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,805
- I-I think you mean school's in.
- What are...

405
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,306
- What are you talking about?
- I-If you're teaching fear,

406
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:00,185
then choking me... school would be in.

407
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,562
Fine.
School's in, bitch.

408
00:17:03,563 --> 00:17:04,898
Oh.

409
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,025
What the fuck?

410
00:17:12,572 --> 00:17:14,866
Ohh! Are we dead?
D-Did we die?

411
00:17:14,991 --> 00:17:16,284
I don't ever want to be high again.

412
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,568
I-I got scared straight.

413
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,036
Oh, my God, I got scared straight.

414
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,372
Fuck. Dad was right.

415
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:21,664
We... We think we know everything,

416
00:17:21,748 --> 00:17:23,448
but maybe we're the ones who suck.

417
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,044
You kids are my fucking heroes!

418
00:17:27,128 --> 00:17:28,921
You saved Grandpa's life!
I fucking love you so much!

419
00:17:29,005 --> 00:17:30,465
- Papa!
- Papa!

420
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,757
We played video games and got high!

421
00:17:31,841 --> 00:17:33,009
We did wrong!
We did wrong!

422
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,385
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, little boopas.

423
00:17:34,469 --> 00:17:37,222
Come on, now. You kids,
you did real good here.

424
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,682
You did good.
Getting high

425
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,099
and playing video games is the best,

426
00:17:40,183 --> 00:17:41,726
- I swear to fucking God.
- But mom and dad

427
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,436
- are gonna be mad.
- No, hey, hey, look, no.

428
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,063
Fuck your mom and dad.
Your parents are a bag of dicks.

429
00:17:46,147 --> 00:17:48,065
Getting high and playing
video games is the best,

430
00:17:48,149 --> 00:17:49,609
and I will never sell you out, ever.

431
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,152
Now, we got to get out of here
before this guy

432
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,404
falls out of the sky.

433
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,697
He's generating an ionic cloud
from his own belief system.

434
00:17:54,781 --> 00:17:56,824
Holy shit, Summer, were you smoking this?

435
00:17:56,908 --> 00:17:58,242
You were basically inhaling brake fluid.

436
00:17:58,326 --> 00:17:59,369
Jesus!

437
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,081
Mm, yeah.

438
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:11,262
It's over, Beth. Tell your
people to lower the gates

439
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,174
and pack their moisture-wicking shirts.

440
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,010
Incoming!

441
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,351
Jerry!

442
00:18:23,476 --> 00:18:25,645
Beth!
Just hold on!

443
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,397
I'm losing my grip!

444
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:30,817
- Jerry.
- Squeeb?

445
00:18:30,942 --> 00:18:34,446
Use the s'more, Jerry.

446
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:35,655
Ow!
You stabbed my hand!

447
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:36,906
Sorry! Sorry!

448
00:18:40,118 --> 00:18:41,911
Should... Should we make love?

449
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,955
Jerry, I love you, but I can literally

450
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,166
- smell your balls from here.
- Oh, wow.

451
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,085
Ask God for a flood next time.
It'll come with a shower.

452
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,171
Noted.

453
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,964
Aw, geez, that... that poor guy.

454
00:18:53,089 --> 00:18:54,549
Can you maybe not tell Mom and Dad?

455
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,051
Relax, it's just a Zeus.
If this was the real God, it...

456
00:18:57,135 --> 00:18:59,512
It'd be a completely different story.

457
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,098
Rick! What did you do?!

458
00:19:02,223 --> 00:19:03,641
I mean, gravity did most of it.

459
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:06,770
- So, you, technically.
- I told you to leave!

460
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,854
Yeah, well, you also asked me
to raise your kids.

461
00:19:08,938 --> 00:19:11,148
Uh, not sure if you heard
the phrase, "pick a lane,"

462
00:19:11,232 --> 00:19:12,942
- but...
- You killed their father!

463
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,986
Father or not, he was
a lying piece of shit.

464
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,821
I don't care who else stuffed your crust,

465
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,406
but I'm the guy that showed up.

466
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,658
But I mean, if you want,
I can still power-wash his guts

467
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:23,286
- off the tower and maybe...
- Get oooout!

468
00:19:23,411 --> 00:19:24,746
Okay, yeah, she's pissed.

469
00:19:24,871 --> 00:19:26,497
I mean, you killed her
slam piece, Grandpa.

470
00:19:26,581 --> 00:19:28,041
I don't blame her.

471
00:19:41,596 --> 00:19:44,849
See? You put the fire stick
to the wood, and, voilà!

472
00:19:44,974 --> 00:19:45,892
Campfire.

473
00:19:46,017 --> 00:19:47,768
You have known about this the whole time?

474
00:19:47,852 --> 00:19:49,687
I'm not gonna waste my time
building you an ark,

475
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:52,398
but if your mom gets clingy, you
can use this to get some space.

476
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:54,859
Is that all you want to say to
your children before you leave?

477
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,570
Oh, yeah, uh, don't ask me for money.

478
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,367
I mean, Gaia's not gonna raise those guys

479
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,244
to hunt us down, right?

480
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,370
Oh, most definitely.
I put a tracker on their ship.

481
00:20:06,454 --> 00:20:08,122
I'll blow it up if they come
anywhere near me.

482
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:10,375
Well, kids, never thought
I'd say this, but,

483
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,251
- Summer, you were right.
- Wait, what?

484
00:20:12,335 --> 00:20:14,462
I thought I wanted
to teach you guys about tents,

485
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,631
but really,
I just wanted to feel important.

486
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,299
I guess sometimes teenagers do know

487
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,509
what they're talking about,
even if it's mean.

488
00:20:20,593 --> 00:20:23,543
Right, but didn't you, like,
go into god-mode and fight mom?

489
00:20:23,638 --> 00:20:25,723
Love is the only power
that matters, Morty.

490
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,059
No, you had actual power,
and you did jack shit.

491
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,561
That was a divine staff.

492
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,312
You could've cured cancer
or raised the dead.

493
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,814
- Instead you made bugs.
- Well, I was impressed, Dad.

494
00:20:33,898 --> 00:20:36,443
He saved my life, no thanks to you.

495
00:20:38,903 --> 00:20:40,321
Your kids got high on alien mist

496
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,906
and drove the ship
into that Zeus guy's head.

497
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,282
- Basically murdered him.
- Grandpa!

498
00:20:43,366 --> 00:20:44,617
- What the hell?!
- Come on!

499
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,369
I mean, not to cast the first stone,

500
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,329
but, Beth and Jerry, pretty
terrible parenting on your part.

501
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,039
Did you know Summer huffed a K-Zax Array?

502
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,582
She basically
smoked "The Ring."

503
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,084
Most pilots die after three days.

504
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,669
And Morty, the fucking moron, he thought

505
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,545
the ship worked like a game controller.

506
00:20:56,629 --> 00:20:58,381
What in the Disney Channel fuck is that?

507
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,007
Maybe help him with homework next time.

508
00:21:00,091 --> 00:21:01,885
He's clearly crying for help.

509
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,211
Planets Only.
Planets Only. Planets Only.

510
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:39,506
Entire systems of steamy, lush globes

511
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,217
and barely habitable celestial objects

512
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,719
are drifting through
the void just for you.

513
00:21:44,844 --> 00:21:46,846
- Planets Only.
- Let's terraform.

514
00:21:46,971 --> 00:21:49,724
- Or colonize me as I am.
- Planets Only.

515
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:52,185
Oops, there's a hole in my ozone.

516
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,020
I didn't put it there.
Did you?

517
00:21:54,145 --> 00:21:57,482
I can't fill it by myself.
I'm not smart enough.

518
00:21:57,607 --> 00:22:00,193
Young, dumb, and orbiting a sun.

519
00:22:00,318 --> 00:22:03,279
The greenhouse is in full effect
at Planets Only.

520
00:22:03,404 --> 00:22:04,905
Oh, I want you to split my Pangea

521
00:22:04,989 --> 00:22:06,239
into distinct continents.

522
00:22:06,324 --> 00:22:08,868
I don't have hydrostatic equilibrium yet.

523
00:22:08,993 --> 00:22:10,870
<i>Is that something you can learn?</i>

524
00:22:10,995 --> 00:22:12,789
<i>You get the idea.</i>

525
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:14,624
Phew!

526
00:22:14,749 --> 00:22:16,625
I was watching over your
shoulder for a full minute.

527
00:22:16,709 --> 00:22:18,085
So? I was watching because
it's funny.

528
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:19,545
It's... It's... They... They...
They're planets,

529
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,464
but they're sexy.
It's a comedic premise.

530
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:24,425
- Yeah.
<i>- Planets Only.</i>

531
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,052
<i>Planets Only.</i>
