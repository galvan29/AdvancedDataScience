left Cronenberg world.

512
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:58,423
Yeah, Cronenberg Rick,

513
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,347
but, you know, I'm gonna miss
Cronenberg world,

514
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,968
because everyone
was Cronenberged all along

515
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:03,720
like us from the beginning,
you know?

516
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,347
I mean, l-I wish we hadn't
genetically ruined

517
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,349
Cronenberg World
beyond repair like we did,

518
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,976
you know, and turned everyone
into regular, normal people

519
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:11,519
just walking around.

520
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,204
Don't you worry about
that sort of thing,

521
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,356
Cronenberg Morty.

522
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,734
Let's go make ourselves
at home, huh?

523
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:22,864
Did you get any of that?

524
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:24,908
It's a good-a show!
