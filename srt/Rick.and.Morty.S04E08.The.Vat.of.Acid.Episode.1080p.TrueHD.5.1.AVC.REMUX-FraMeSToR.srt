1
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,927
Oh, shit, I almost parked.

2
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:14,138
Hey, Morty, hold on, wat-watch this.

3
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:22,730
Uh-huh.

4
00:00:22,855 --> 00:00:24,022
Well, I thought it was cool.

5
00:00:24,106 --> 00:00:25,525
So.
We should be in and out.

6
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,151
Simple exchange,
not even really an adventure.

7
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:29,194
And if anything goes wrong...
Which it won't...

8
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:30,988
Jump into the same vat of acid
I jump into.

9
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:32,573
Okay.
Wait... Wait, what?

10
00:00:32,698 --> 00:00:34,158
- Wha-What vat of acid?
- What, Morty!

11
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:35,409
Close the door.

12
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,078
I pre-scouted this location

13
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,662
and placed a vat of fake acid
amongst the real ones.

14
00:00:38,746 --> 00:00:40,039
It's got air hoses

15
00:00:40,164 --> 00:00:41,457
and a compartment of bones at the bottom.

16
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,208
If things go wrong, which they won't,

17
00:00:43,292 --> 00:00:44,752
we jump into the vat of acid,

18
00:00:44,877 --> 00:00:46,211
and I'll release the bones,
they'll float up...

19
00:00:46,295 --> 00:00:47,838
What is this face you're making?

20
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:49,507
Aren't you an inventor?

21
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,425
Yeah, what part of a fake acid
vat with built-in air supply

22
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:53,844
and quick-release bones
isn't inventive enough for you,

23
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:56,013
and when did my job become
pitching you ideas?

24
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,974
Alright!
Let's just do this.

25
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,267
- I have English homework.
- You're still learning English?

26
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:01,978
That's the language you speak.

27
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,980
How dumb are you?

28
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,443
Interesting choice
of meeting place, Rick.

29
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,227
You like it?
My grandson had notes.

30
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,370
- Come on.
- Show him the crystals, Morty.

31
00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:20,371
I'll make lots of money with these.

32
00:01:20,496 --> 00:01:21,830
I'll make lots of those with these.

33
00:01:21,914 --> 00:01:23,457
- Well. Those are fake.
- Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.

34
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:24,625
- Come on.
- You gotta be kidding me.

35
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:25,793
Seriously?

36
00:01:25,918 --> 00:01:27,336
You brought fake crystals <i>and</i> a gun?

37
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,088
Beats real crystals and no gun.

38
00:01:29,213 --> 00:01:32,133
Okay, but does anything beat
fake crystals and a fake arm?

39
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,051
Whoa, do you know who I am?!

40
00:01:34,176 --> 00:01:36,178
Even if you kill me, you're a dead man.

41
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,430
Are you serious?

42
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:38,889
Morty, he's right.
We're screwed.

43
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,641
Let's just end it.
Quick death, come on.

44
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:43,769
Aw, man. Oh!

45
00:01:43,894 --> 00:01:45,354
Eh!

46
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,857
Holy shit, what the fuck?

47
00:01:55,364 --> 00:01:56,657
Holy shit.

48
00:01:56,782 --> 00:01:58,409
What kind of psycho...?

49
00:01:58,534 --> 00:02:00,119
His own grandson?

50
00:02:01,537 --> 00:02:03,288
<i>Guess he took your threat pretty serious.</i>

51
00:02:03,372 --> 00:02:04,624
<i>Yeah, but it just</i>

52
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,250
<i>doesn't make any sense.</i>

53
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:08,210
<i>Well, he was a scientist.</i>

54
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:09,879
<i>Maybe he knew more about acid,</i>

55
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:12,465
<i>maybe it's like
the most painless way to go.</i>

56
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,675
<i>How could that have been painless?</i>

57
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,303
<i>You saw that pause
before the bones floated up,</i>

58
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:20,264
<i>that had to be five seconds
of unparalleled torture.</i>

59
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:22,558
<i>I...
I can't get my head around it.</i>

60
00:02:22,683 --> 00:02:26,062
<i>I-I thought I'd seen
this galaxy at its darkest.</i>

61
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:29,273
<i>This is... This is gonna take
a while to feel normal.</i>

62
00:02:29,398 --> 00:02:30,941
<i>We're pretty good listeners, boss.</i>

63
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,734
<i>Drinks are on us
if you want to talk it out.</i>

64
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:34,111
<i>Thanks, but</i>

65
00:02:34,236 --> 00:02:36,656
<i>what happened, it happened here.</i>

66
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:37,948
<i>I don't want to lose the moment.</i>

67
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:39,408
<i>Take your time, boss.</i>

68
00:02:39,533 --> 00:02:40,784
<i>We'll stay here as long as you want.</i>

69
00:02:40,868 --> 00:02:43,204
<i>Absolutely.
I got nowhere to be.</i>

70
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:20,950
And then little Tommy FlimFlam's

71
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,910
running down the Hyperloop.

72
00:03:23,035 --> 00:03:25,705
His ass is on fire from Xenon fluid,

73
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,708
but his Al hologram
is fuckin' his own pee hole.

74
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:32,586
- Great story, boss.
- Really detailed.

75
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,714
Yeah, well, I got a million of 'em.

76
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,716
<i>Alright.</i>

77
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,008
<i>I think I'm ready
to deal with the world now.</i>

78
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,218
<i>Let's get out of here.</i>

79
00:03:39,343 --> 00:03:40,677
<i>Should we drop our buddy in here</i>

80
00:03:40,761 --> 00:03:41,679
<i>before we go?</i>

81
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,138
<i>Yeah, probably a good idea.</i>

82
00:03:43,222 --> 00:03:44,932
<i>Should we use a different vat?</i>

83
00:03:45,057 --> 00:03:47,184
<i>Does acid lose its acid power
the more it dissolves?</i>

84
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:48,602
<i>What am I, an acidologist?</i>

85
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,187
<i>Here, grab that ratlike creature,</i>

86
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:53,357
<i>we'll do a little test.</i>

87
00:03:53,482 --> 00:03:54,941
<i>Look, if you're going
to test the damn acid,</i>

88
00:03:55,025 --> 00:03:56,318
<i>don't use a rat,</i>

89
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:57,819
<i>take that ladle, grab a spoonful,</i>

90
00:03:57,903 --> 00:03:59,905
<i>and put it in the analyzer.</i>

91
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,410
- Oh!
- Hey!

92
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:08,122
Okay, I'd say that's
pretty acidy. Drop him in.

93
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,000
<i>What are you doing?</i>

94
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,417
<i>- You said...
- Not the rat!</i>

95
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:13,753
<i>The guy!</i>

96
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,755
<i>Ooh! Marone!</i>

97
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,839
<i>Look at the size
of the bones on that rat!</i>

98
00:04:17,923 --> 00:04:19,216
<i>Oh!</i>

99
00:04:19,341 --> 00:04:20,926
<i>How many sets of bones this rat got?</i>

100
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,761
<i>And look how the smaller ones are shaped!</i>

101
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:24,429
<i>They're like little cartoon bones,</i>

102
00:04:24,513 --> 00:04:26,557
<i>like if you drew a bone in art class!</i>

103
00:04:26,682 --> 00:04:27,850
Alright, that tears it.

104
00:04:27,975 --> 00:04:29,434
I'm canceling the rest of my night

105
00:04:29,518 --> 00:04:30,968
and calling a bone scientist.

106
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:32,270
We're getting to the bottom of this...

107
00:04:32,354 --> 00:04:34,315
Jesus fucking Christ, enough already!

108
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,733
- Hey!
- Whoa!

109
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,753
Can we go?

110
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,464
The fuck is wrong with you?

111
00:04:59,548 --> 00:05:00,924
Just admit it was a shitty idea!

112
00:05:01,008 --> 00:05:02,218
Having a grandson?

113
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:03,844
A vat of fake acid!

114
00:05:03,969 --> 00:05:05,262
Are you dying of dementia?

115
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:06,513
How are you talking to me like this?

116
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:07,973
Wh-When did you get so cocky?

117
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,433
Tonight!
Tonight, Rick!

118
00:05:09,558 --> 00:05:10,808
The night I saw you fail!

119
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,686
- Because you ruined it!
- It was pre-ruined!

120
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,479
Oh, was it worse than
when I was a pickle?

121
00:05:14,563 --> 00:05:16,273
Oh-oh-oh that's right,
you weren't there for that.

122
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,817
Turned out kind of cool.

123
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,484
- Maybe there's
a connection there.
- Excuse me?

124
00:05:19,568 --> 00:05:21,486
What's that cool thing
you did without me again?

125
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,696
The awesome thing?

126
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,657
I-I-I guess you wanted a dragon?

127
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:26,075
Mwah. Unforgettable.

128
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,368
God, fuck you.

129
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,869
Timely, too, you really got in on that

130
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,412
"Game of Thrones" fever
right at the peak.

131
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,330
You trying as hard
as you can to hurt me right now

132
00:05:32,414 --> 00:05:33,707
proves my point.

133
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,333
I'll let you know when you have a point

134
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:37,502
and the world will know
when I try to hurt you.

135
00:05:37,586 --> 00:05:40,089
Big man, big genius.
Big lonely drunk.

136
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:42,299
Hey, save some of these
atomic-age beatnik zingers

137
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,183
for your English homework, Bukowski.

138
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,096
There's no such thing
as a bad idea, Morty.

139
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,015
It's about execution.

140
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,560
No such thing as a bad idea?

141
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,271
Except all of mine, right?

142
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,296
Morty, wanting a dragon isn't an idea.

143
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:58,648
I'm not talking about that!

144
00:05:58,732 --> 00:06:00,732
I'm constantly pitching you ideas, Rick,

145
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:02,319
and you act like they're
not even worth thinking about!

146
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,862
What, the helicopter lawn chair?

147
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,405
That's just something you saw on TV.

148
00:06:05,489 --> 00:06:07,989
What about my video-game-style
place-saving device?

149
00:06:08,075 --> 00:06:11,287
Oh, my God, here we go.

150
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,538
It's a good idea, Rick!
A device that lets you...

151
00:06:13,622 --> 00:06:14,956
Save your place like in a video game

152
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,541
but in real life
so that you can try stuff

153
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:17,959
and then go back to your save point,

154
00:06:18,043 --> 00:06:19,743
yes, Morty,
I saw it on "Futurama."

155
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,713
Oh, so you don't do anything
unless it's original?

156
00:06:21,797 --> 00:06:23,340
I don't do time travel.

157
00:06:23,465 --> 00:06:24,966
It's not time travel,
it's saving a place in time...

158
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,136
Oh, my God, is this what you think I do?

159
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:29,346
This is where the heavy lifting
happens in your mind?

160
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,889
Do you have any idea
how much fucking work

161
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,349
would have to go into a machine that...

162
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,184
Ah-ha!
You can't do it!

163
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,729
I can do anything, Morty.

164
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,647
Your idea is not worth doing.

165
00:06:38,772 --> 00:06:40,190
You can't do it.

166
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,192
Before what you're trying to do
was called "negging,"

167
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,985
it was called "reverse psychology,"

168
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:46,363
and incels didn't invent it,
Bugs Bunny did.

169
00:06:46,488 --> 00:06:49,074
- You can't do it.
- There is nothing I cannot do.

170
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,158
A place-saving video-game thing!

171
00:06:50,242 --> 00:06:51,284
You're a piece of shit!

172
00:06:51,368 --> 00:06:52,869
- Just say you can't do it!
- I won't!

173
00:06:52,953 --> 00:06:54,163
You won't say you can't?

174
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:55,580
- Fuck you, Morty!
- Fuck you!

175
00:06:55,664 --> 00:06:57,750
Fuck you!

176
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,460
Son of a bitch.

177
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:06,064
- So are you gonna...
- Yes, I'm gonna fucking do it!

178
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:08,886
Rick, it's 3:00 a.m.

179
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,929
Wh-Wh-What's going on?
W-Why'd you call me?

180
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,723
You were right, Morty.

181
00:07:12,848 --> 00:07:14,266
I failed.
I can't make it.

182
00:07:14,391 --> 00:07:15,976
And honestly, I'm pretty ashamed.

183
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,769
That might be why I've been
so aggressive and unfair

184
00:07:17,853 --> 00:07:19,145
about rejecting your ideas.

185
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:21,106
- Rick...
- A fake acid vat, Morty?

186
00:07:21,231 --> 00:07:23,149
Maybe I've lost it.
Maybe I never had it.

187
00:07:23,233 --> 00:07:24,943
Hey. C'mon. Y-You know
I didn't mean it that way.

188
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:27,070
I just think we need to find
better ways to communicate.

189
00:07:27,154 --> 00:07:28,864
I'm sorry. I just...
I lash out sometimes.

190
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,241
I-I-I don't know why I do that!
I'm so ashamed of myself.

191
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:32,492
Hearing you talk about the vat

192
00:07:32,576 --> 00:07:34,036
it really opened my eyes.

193
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:35,328
Like what the fuck am I even doing?

194
00:07:35,412 --> 00:07:36,580
Hey. Hey.
I don't like hearing this talk.

195
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:37,864
You're a great inventor.

196
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,374
We just got a couple things to work on.

197
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,167
Let's start with inventing
a little honesty.

198
00:07:41,251 --> 00:07:42,169
Sound good?

199
00:07:42,294 --> 00:07:43,587
Thank you, Morty.
Sounds good.

200
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:44,963
- Or maybe I'll just kill you.
- What?

201
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,882
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Rick...

202
00:07:49,885 --> 00:07:52,137
- Because I fucking did it!
- Oh-ho-ho!

203
00:07:52,262 --> 00:07:53,681
- Booya!
- Holy shit!

204
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:54,932
You did it!
You did it!

205
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:55,974
I did it, you little son of a bitch!

206
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:57,184
How did you...

207
00:07:57,309 --> 00:07:58,518
Morty, do you want me to explain,

208
00:07:58,602 --> 00:08:00,020
- or you wanna go have some fun?
- I wanna have some fun!

209
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,355
Oh, my God.

210
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,189
Rick, this is... this is... thank you!

211
00:08:03,273 --> 00:08:04,566
You can thank me later.
Go nuts.

212
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,776
Best grandpa ever!

213
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:07,551
That's all I ever wanted to hear.

214
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,115
Alright, class,

215
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,824
I know I've been absent
for most of this school year.

216
00:08:12,908 --> 00:08:14,701
I'll be honest with you...
During spring break,

217
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,495
I attended a renaissance faire

218
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,748
and fell in love with a buxom
hand-axe juggler half my age.

219
00:08:19,873 --> 00:08:21,666
I overplayed my interest in her lifestyle

220
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,001
just to get closer to her,

221
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,794
traveling the country with her troupe,

222
00:08:24,878 --> 00:08:27,547
and I am embarrassed to say
I am now an expert blacksmith

223
00:08:27,631 --> 00:08:29,758
with several STDs and a broken heart.

224
00:08:29,883 --> 00:08:31,426
I beseech your nasty little asses

225
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,210
to speak on the matter no further.

226
00:08:33,303 --> 00:08:35,805
Now that that's out of the way,
who wants to do some math?

227
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:37,933
- I'll do it.
- A bold move, Morty Smith.

228
00:08:38,058 --> 00:08:39,226
But can you deliver?

229
00:08:39,351 --> 00:08:40,852
Oh, I've got something to deliver.

230
00:08:40,936 --> 00:08:42,938
Ahh!
Oh, God.

231
00:08:43,063 --> 00:08:44,273
What the hell!

232
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,066
Aw, goddamnit, this is traumatizing.

233
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,152
Oh, my God, what's wrong with your dick?

234
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:50,237
- Not cool.
- I'm allergic to sheepskin!

235
00:08:50,362 --> 00:08:52,740
Bold move, Morty Smith.
But can you deliver?

236
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,366
Holy shit.
I can do anything.

237
00:08:54,491 --> 00:08:56,410
Yes, with math, anything is possible.

238
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:58,119
Except a long-term relationship
with a woman

239
00:08:58,203 --> 00:09:00,706
that calls you a warlock
for using a phone.

240
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,461
Hi, uh, hey, Jessica.

241
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,504
Oh.
Hey, Morty.

242
00:09:09,923 --> 00:09:11,592
Hey...
Jessica, right?

243
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,886
Um. Yeah.
Hi. Sorry.

244
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,220
I thought you knew my name

245
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:16,638
because we've interacted so many times,

246
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,682
but maybe I was just being stupid.

247
00:09:18,807 --> 00:09:21,018
Sorry. Hi.
I-I'm Jessica. That's me.

248
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:22,269
Cool.
See you around.

249
00:09:22,394 --> 00:09:23,853
Jessica. Yeah.
I hope I see you.

250
00:09:23,937 --> 00:09:25,814
- Around.
- Guess we'll see.

251
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:29,234

Hey, I'm sorry I brushed you off
the other day.

285
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,735
I was just trying to be cool...

286
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,236
Oh, I don't even know
what you're talking about.

287
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,155
But...
you seem different.

288
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,573
Like you finally found yourself.

289
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,158
Yeah.
I... I guess I have.

290
00:15:10,283 --> 00:15:12,619
That's good to hear.
I like who you found.

291
00:15:12,744 --> 00:15:14,538
Yeah.
Yeah, I do, too.

292
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,873
Looking forward to seeing more.

293
00:15:16,998 --> 00:15:18,207
I'll see you tomorrow, Morty.

294
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,544
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.

295
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,300
How's it going?

296
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,843
Y'know, it was fun, Rick.
Real fun.

297
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:30,678
Y'know I-I-I definitely sowed those oats.

298
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:31,972
But I think you invented

299
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,947
a little lesson for me along the way.

300
00:15:34,057 --> 00:15:35,433
Living without consequences is great,

301
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:36,809
but then I started wondering

302
00:15:36,893 --> 00:15:38,145
what am I living <i>for?</i>

303
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,729
What am I building?

304
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,522
If I'm always looking back,
I'm never looking ahead.

305
00:15:41,606 --> 00:15:42,858
And then it hit me.

306
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:45,152
We are who we are
because of consequences.

307
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,427
You can't live
without consequences, y'know?

308
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:48,697
You feel me?

309
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,991
Wow.

310
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,743
That's a beautiful thought,
Morty, but, uh, no.

311
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,536
There were definitely consequences.

312
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,871
What're-What-What are you talking about?

313
00:15:56,955 --> 00:15:58,790
I mean.
You did everything you did.

314
00:15:58,915 --> 00:16:00,083
It all happened.

315
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,459
No.
But the... the respawn button.

316
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,628
- The... The do-over.
- It's not a do-over.

317
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,505
You just did it.
Over and over.

318
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,256
What are you saying?
W-What did you do?

319
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,342
I think it's more appropriate
to ask what did <i>you</i> do?

320
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:11,094
You see, Morty, you weren't
saving your place

321
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,387
and going back.

322
00:16:12,512 --> 00:16:13,972
I don't respect time travel.

323
00:16:14,097 --> 00:16:16,682
If "Ant Man and the Wasp"
can do it, I'm not interested.

324
00:16:16,766 --> 00:16:18,059
It wasn't so much a do-over

325
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,352
as it was isolating a moment in time,

326
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:20,853
splitting your probable selves,

327
00:16:20,937 --> 00:16:22,647
and shunting you into
to into a near-duplicate,

328
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:25,233
equally probable reality,
transporting you into it

329
00:16:25,358 --> 00:16:27,110
at the moment of parallel determination.

330
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,487
Pretty nifty. Time crystals
are a bitch and a half,

331
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:32,324
but the only real hitch is that
there was already a you

332
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:33,658
in each probable dimension.

333
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,368
So we had to solve for that.

334
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,125
That's right, you little bitch!

335
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,085
It's "The Prestige"!
You "Prestige'd" yourself!

336
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,129
- Rick, how many did I kill?
- You tell me, Morty.

337
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,381
Every time you reset
to smell Jessica's hair,

338
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,717
every time you relived a satisfying fart,

339
00:16:50,842 --> 00:16:52,510
that's how many Mortys
you've incinerated,

340
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:53,887
you greedy little junkie.

341
00:16:54,012 --> 00:16:55,972
Oh, God... even those times when I...

342
00:16:56,097 --> 00:16:57,849
Especially those times.

343
00:16:57,974 --> 00:16:59,726
It's over, Morty. Feel this.

344
00:16:59,851 --> 00:17:01,353
Take this in.
This is God.

345
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,312
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh... Why would you do this?

346
00:17:03,396 --> 00:17:05,696
My hands are clean, Morty.
I gave you a choice.

347
00:17:05,815 --> 00:17:07,233
You could listen to me explain,

348
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,653
in great scientific detail,
how it all works,

349
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:10,904
or you could have fun.

350
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:12,196
Did you have fun, Morty?

351
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,823
Is this because of the vat?

352
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,492
- No.
- I'm sorry.

353
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:16,993
I'm afraid it's too late for that, Morty.

354
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,246
What's done is done, but it can end.

355
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,330
The original split is still timestamped.

356
00:17:21,414 --> 00:17:23,624
I can make it so those Mortys
never existed at all,

357
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:24,876
make them purely theoretical.

358
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,211
Oh, God.
What do I do?

359
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,795
I think it's clear you've done enough.

360
00:17:27,879 --> 00:17:30,214
Tell me how, Rick!
Tell me how I save those Mortys!

361
00:17:30,298 --> 00:17:31,466
You live with the consequences.

362
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,800
Those things happened somewhere,

363
00:17:32,884 --> 00:17:34,719
but you can merge the probable realities

364
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,403
so that only one Morty did them.

365
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:37,639
Just do it.

366
00:17:37,764 --> 00:17:39,182
Alright, lemme just sync these up

367
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,558
and get you back to your dimension.

368
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,518
Wait, so... so you're not even my Rick?

369
00:17:42,602 --> 00:17:44,061
Then... Then why do you know
about the vat?

370
00:17:44,145 --> 00:17:45,313
Every Rick has a vat!

371
00:17:55,782 --> 00:17:57,033
Well, Morty, I'd say

372
00:17:57,158 --> 00:17:59,327
we've invented a little honesty today.

373
00:17:59,452 --> 00:18:00,828
- How about you?
- I don't deserve this.

374
00:18:00,912 --> 00:18:02,038
I was just having fun.

375
00:18:02,163 --> 00:18:03,331
So was Jeffrey Dahmer.

376
00:18:03,456 --> 00:18:05,333
Speaking of, time to pay the piper.

377
00:18:07,335 --> 00:18:09,921
Morty Smith.

378
00:18:10,046 --> 00:18:12,340
Come out with your hands up,
you sick fuck.

379
00:18:12,465 --> 00:18:14,175
We're also fine with just shooting you

380
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,885
if you wanna suicide by cop.

381
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,137
What?
What is this?

382
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,612
Wow.
Looks like a SWAT Team,

383
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,015
some drug dealers,

384
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,934
some grassroots #MeToo activists,
the ACLU...

385
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:24,686
Jesus, Morty, the AARP?

386
00:18:24,811 --> 00:18:27,396
- I don't wanna talk about it!
- The NAACP, GamerGate...

387
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,317
Morty, is that Supreme Court
Justice Sonia Sotomayor?

388
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,901
I'm sorry!
I... I'm sorry!

389
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,402
I-Is that what you want me to say?

390
00:18:33,486 --> 00:18:35,780
- What... What do I do?
- Oof, well, I'm stumped.

391
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:37,865
Seems like there's no way
out of this one.

392
00:18:37,949 --> 00:18:39,075
Unless...

393
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,577
God damn it.

394
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,787
Yeah, I guess it is, uh...
What did you call it?

395
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,956
Uh, uh, "A shitty idea"?

396
00:18:45,081 --> 00:18:47,167
- God damn it.
- Say the vat is good.

397
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,127
The vat is good.

398
00:18:49,252 --> 00:18:51,087
Kiss the vat.

399
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,758
Do not go into that vat.

400
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:56,760
It appears to be full of acid.

401
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,762
It is!
Please, he's just a little boy!

402
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,180
- Let me talk to him.
- Tell him we're very upset!

403
00:19:01,264 --> 00:19:02,474
Morty, please.
Step back.

404
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,975
That vat is full of acid.

405
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,519
It'll melt you completely,
leaving only your bones.

406
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,104
- Goddamn it!
- I'm sorry, what did you say?

407
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,314
I'm going in the vat!

408
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:15,403
Oh! God!
Aw, I blame myself!

409
00:19:15,528 --> 00:19:17,030
Oh, what a tragedy.

410
00:19:17,155 --> 00:19:19,324
This... Oh, well, he's bones now.

411
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:20,616
I guess all debts are paid.

412
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,410
Agreed.
He's definitely dead.

413
00:19:22,535 --> 00:19:24,788
Why else would the bones come up?

414
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,623
While his actions were horrifying

415
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:29,417
and we are well within
our rights to be outraged,

416
00:19:29,542 --> 00:19:31,795
I do wonder if we bear
some responsibility

417
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,172
for this young man
melting himself in acid.

418
00:19:34,297 --> 00:19:36,841
Are we here for justice...
or something else?

419
00:19:36,966 --> 00:19:40,053
"Though justice be thy plea,
consider this,

420
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:42,263
that in the course of justice

421
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,808
none of us should see salvation.

422
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:46,476
We do pray for mercy."

423
00:19:46,601 --> 00:19:47,951
"Merchant of Venice," nice.

424
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,478
Very cool.
Lots to think about.

425
00:19:49,562 --> 00:19:51,480
Vengeance is a tomb, all-encompassing...

426
00:19:51,564 --> 00:19:54,651
Alright, okay, this isn't a
poetry reading, a kid just died.

427
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:58,196
Every... Everybody go home and
hug your loved one or something.

428
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:04,327
Wait.

429
00:20:04,452 --> 00:20:05,828
How do we know that's really acid

430
00:20:05,912 --> 00:20:07,663
and you didn't just have
someone's bones in there?

431
00:20:07,747 --> 00:20:09,290
I mean, if you're doubting
if that's really acid

432
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,958
and not just Jacuzzi-heated Mountain Dew,

433
00:20:11,042 --> 00:20:12,460
you're welcome to use this ladle.

434
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,462
You think I'm a goddamn idiot?

435
00:20:14,587 --> 00:20:16,589
Brought my own.

436
00:20:21,302 --> 00:20:22,595
Aah!

437
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:23,847
Oh, God!
Oh, God no!

438
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,432
Oh, God, no!
Oh, no... Huh?

439
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,142
I'm acid-proof!

440
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,102
Fuck all of you, fuck all of you,

441
00:20:29,227 --> 00:20:30,478
I'm gonna be rich!

442
00:20:30,603 --> 00:20:31,813
Here's my ass.

443
00:20:31,938 --> 00:20:33,732
Take a good look, spank it!

444
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,316
Acid proof!

445
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:38,319
Feels like that guy
had other stuff going on.

446
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,697
Don't ever make fun of me again.

447
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,866
Ever!

448
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,408
Alright, c'mon Morty, let's go home.

449
00:20:44,492 --> 00:20:46,160
Wait, what?
This... This isn't our reality?

450
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:47,536
What, you think I'd waste our home

451
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,164
teaching you a fucking lesson?

452
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,082
I am gonna miss this place, though...

453
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,917
Johnny Carson's still alive
and on the air,

454
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,252
9/11 never happened,

455
00:20:54,377 --> 00:20:55,795
and Rocky Road ice cream
has peanut butter

456
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:57,713
- instead of marshmallows.
- The fu... What?

457
00:20:57,797 --> 00:20:58,964
The marshmallows are the best part!

458
00:20:59,048 --> 00:21:00,633
Morty...

459
00:21:37,712 --> 00:21:39,422
Our next guest, ah, gave us,

460
00:21:39,547 --> 00:21:41,132
well, actually, very little information,

461
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:45,386
ah, besides the fact that he is,
uh, impervious to acid.

462
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,388
So here he is, he's here to prove it.

463
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:50,350
Let's welcome this guy.

464
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,810
Let's do this shit!

465
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:53,102
Now, you're, uh...
You're sure about this?

466
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,395
Eat my ass!
Hoist me!

467
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:57,732
I did not know that ass was on the menu.

468
00:21:57,857 --> 00:21:59,359
Don't steal my moment!
Do it!

469
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:03,154
Ah, okay, then without
further ado... drop him.

470
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:04,572
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!

471
00:22:04,697 --> 00:22:06,574
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah!

472
00:22:18,753 --> 00:22:21,422
Looks like I'll be eating ass flambé.

473
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:24,509
Please kill me.
