1
00:00:05,087 --> 00:00:06,047
We're out of syrup.

2
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:07,298
Huh.
You know what?

3
00:00:07,423 --> 00:00:09,717
Maybe I'll use my intern.

4
00:00:09,842 --> 00:00:12,136
- Glootie?
- Good?

5
00:00:12,261 --> 00:00:13,961
- Thanks, Glootie.
- Anything else?

6
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:15,389
Do you want to develop an app?

7
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:17,099
- No thanks, Glootie.
- Hey, what's up, Glootie?

8
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:18,725
Hi, Morty.
Do you want to develop an app?

9
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:20,269
- No thanks.
- Rick, why does it say,

10
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:22,312
"Do not develop my app,"
on your intern's forehead?

11
00:00:22,396 --> 00:00:23,605
Why, you want to develop one?

12
00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:24,898
Ah, I'm glad you asked that, Jerry.

13
00:00:24,982 --> 00:00:26,567
It's so <i>you</i> don't develop his app.

14
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:28,569
Glootie, go make some
photocopies of something.

15
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:29,779
Cool.

16
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:31,155
Well, if anyone wants
to develop an app with me,

17
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,281
I'm down.

18
00:00:32,406 --> 00:00:34,867
He seems to <i>really</i> want
to develop an app.

19
00:00:34,992 --> 00:00:36,952
He really does, sweetie,
but nobody's gonna do that.

20
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:38,454
Now, if you'll excuse me,

21
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,629
I've got a quick solo adventure to go on,

22
00:00:40,748 --> 00:00:43,292
and this one will <i>not</i> be
directed by Ron Howard.

23
00:00:43,417 --> 00:00:44,334
He's gonna go poop.

24
00:00:44,418 --> 00:00:46,044
When Grandpa Rick pats
his belly like that

25
00:00:46,128 --> 00:00:47,629
and leaves without Morty,
it means he's going to go poop.

26
00:00:47,713 --> 00:00:49,673
He's a shy pooper.
He has a secret pooping place.

27
00:00:49,757 --> 00:00:51,551
Man, fuck you, Summer.

28
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:54,094
Honey, why can't you get
this excited about your SATs?

29
00:00:54,178 --> 00:00:56,973
Well, I'm man enough to simply
say, "I'm going to poop,"

30
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:59,642
and I'd be honored to have
Ron Howard involved.

31
00:00:59,767 --> 00:01:00,851
Good job, hon.

32
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:02,977
- Way to go, Dad.
- We're rooting for ya.

33
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,025
He's really putting you to work, huh?

34
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,359
Did you want to develop an app?

35
00:01:09,443 --> 00:01:11,612
- I'll pass, Glootie.
- Hmm, your loss.

36
00:01:11,737 --> 00:01:13,322
Oh, yeah?
Why's that?

37
00:01:13,447 --> 00:01:14,823
Eh, it's an app you'd want to develop.

38
00:01:14,907 --> 00:01:17,285
- Can I ask what it is?
- Of course you can.

39
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,829
That's always the first step
in app development.

40
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:23,457
Ah.

41
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,917
50/50!
Final offer!

42
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:25,037
Reverse digestion extrapolation.

43
00:03:25,162 --> 00:03:26,789
Time to meet your maker.

44
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,792
What are you guys doing?

45
00:03:29,917 --> 00:03:31,252
Did you develop an app?

46
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,295
Rule number one
in app development, son...

47
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,922
Never follow the rules.

48
00:03:35,047 --> 00:03:38,050
Except when the rule is tattooed
on an alien's forehead, Dad.

49
00:03:38,175 --> 00:03:39,551
Why do you think
Rick would have that rule?

50
00:03:39,635 --> 00:03:41,094
'Cause he's a disrupt-o-phobe.

51
00:03:41,178 --> 00:03:42,513
No, Dad, no.

52
00:03:42,638 --> 00:03:44,056
To keep something horrible
from happening,

53
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,058
something he's too lazy to explain.

54
00:03:46,183 --> 00:03:47,983
Guys, we're getting our first users.

55
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:53,149
Whoa, this new app just matched me

56
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:55,860
with a guy that is su my ty.

57
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,945
Super my type.
Learn to abbre.

58
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,196
Hey!

59
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:01,949
Your su ty works at Jersey Mike's

60
00:04:02,074 --> 00:04:04,160
and sees 25 Phish shows a year.

61
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,579
- That is so Danny.
- Summer!

62
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:08,205
- Danny?
- Summer Smith?

63
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,832
Danny Publits from Lovefinderrz
with two "R's" and a "Z"?

64
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:13,335
I ran all the way here
while staring at your profile.

65
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,920
I tripped on a fire hydrant
and fell down,

66
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,963
so I'm covered in gravel
that stuck to my sweat.

67
00:04:17,047 --> 00:04:18,466
And even after a shower,

68
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,509
I'll still be into a jam band
for old junkies,

69
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,719
but I think this world cares
too much about bands

70
00:04:22,803 --> 00:04:24,972
and too little about love.

71
00:04:25,097 --> 00:04:27,433
- And I think I love you.
- Me, too.

72
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,769
Hi, I'm my under-aged daughter's mother.

73
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,395
Nice to... whoa!

74
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,689
Come on. Just met.

75
00:04:33,814 --> 00:04:35,232
Uh, this isn't working.

76
00:04:35,357 --> 00:04:36,567
Wait. What are you...

77
00:04:36,692 --> 00:04:37,860
Never mind.

78
00:04:37,985 --> 00:04:40,821
I quit, I'm gay, and I love Xander.

79
00:04:40,946 --> 00:04:43,783
Stupid phones are destroying us.

80
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:45,409
Hey, sweetie.

81
00:04:45,534 --> 00:04:47,619
<i>Honey, our daughter
ran off with a Frisbee golfer</i>

82
00:04:47,703 --> 00:04:49,287
<i>because of some app with a really dumb,</i>

83
00:04:49,371 --> 00:04:50,873
<i>really forgettable name.</i>

84
00:04:50,998 --> 00:04:54,627
<i>Like a really dumb, uncreative,
super sweaty name.</i>

85
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:55,919
<i>Anyway, I'll be late.
I love you.</i>

86
00:04:56,003 --> 00:04:58,130
Got it.
I love you, too.

87
00:04:58,255 --> 00:05:00,633
Okay, Glootie, take the app down.

88
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:03,260
Can't take it down.
I'm just an intern.

89
00:05:06,388 --> 00:05:08,057
Uh, that's not how apps work.

90
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,809
Then make it how it works.

91
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,728
This isn't how making things work works.

92
00:05:12,853 --> 00:05:14,187
Get... get it off the server.

93
00:05:14,271 --> 00:05:15,939
Y-You think we're stupid, but we're not.

94
00:05:16,023 --> 00:05:17,983
We know apps have something
to do with servers.

95
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,192
The server's on the mother ship.

96
00:05:19,276 --> 00:05:20,318
Where's the mother ship?

97
00:05:20,402 --> 00:05:21,778
- It's coming.
- Take us to it.

98
00:05:21,862 --> 00:05:23,072
- No.
- Yes.

99
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:24,573
Shake him more, Morty.
That was working.

100
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,007
Take us to the mother ship.

101
00:05:38,587 --> 00:05:40,381
Okay, don't hurt me.
Don't hurt me.

102
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,424
An ominous beeping app.

103
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,593
You can't stay made at a guy
with this kind of talent.

104
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,512
Dad, you can, and you have to.

105
00:05:52,893 --> 00:05:54,603
- Ribbit, ribbit.
- Ribbit, ribbit.

106
00:05:54,728 --> 00:05:56,521
- Hey, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit!
- Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit!

107
00:05:56,605 --> 00:05:58,565
Look at this guy.
He wants to eat me so bad.

108
00:05:58,649 --> 00:05:59,900
You want to eat me, don't you?

109
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,777
- Ribbit.
- Just kidding. Have some drugs.

110
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,862
- Are you Vermigurber?
- What does this guy want?

111
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,781
- Who is this monkey?
- I'm here about a sandwich.

112
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,032
Oh, well you came to the right place

113
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,200
'cause you're about to get

114
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,535
a <i>bullet</i> sandwich

115
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,246
on two slices
of whole... gun.

116
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:14,832
You might want to get that.

117
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,751
Hello?

118
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,777
<i>Dad, give the human whatever he wants.</i>

119
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,797
<i>He knows where I live.
He's crazy!</i>

120
00:06:21,922 --> 00:06:24,258
You fucking idiot.

121
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:27,344
I have 800,000 kids.

122
00:06:27,469 --> 00:06:29,305
Don't forget your voicemail.

123
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:33,809
<i>You have 470,000 messages.</i>

124
00:06:33,934 --> 00:06:35,352
Oh, ah, that's half of them.

125
00:06:35,477 --> 00:06:37,677
Okay, w-w-what do you want?
What do you want?

126
00:06:38,355 --> 00:06:40,405
Wait, this is seriously about sandwiches?

127
00:06:40,524 --> 00:06:42,776
I thought this was about drugs or guns

128
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,861
or the fact that I'm a fly
that runs a frog restaurant.

129
00:06:44,945 --> 00:06:47,280
There's a million things
that are interesting about me,

130
00:06:47,364 --> 00:06:48,698
and none of them are sandwiches.

131
00:06:48,782 --> 00:06:51,160
- Who ordered it?
- Talk to our delivery drone.

132
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,954
He... he run off to fight
in the robot wars.

133
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,166
Hey, ape man, I hope this was worth

134
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,084
making a whole swarm of enemies.

135
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:02,588
It will be when I find
whoever shit in my toilet.

136
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:05,674
Is that code for something?
Someone look that up.

137
00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:07,799
If that's drug slang, I need to know it.

138
00:07:09,219 --> 00:07:10,721
Ah!

139
00:07:10,846 --> 00:07:13,641
- Mom, you can't stop true love.
- Oh, yes, I can.

140
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,058
- You're assaulting me!
- Keep your voice down.

141
00:07:15,142 --> 00:07:16,435
I'm being assaulted!

142
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,811
Oh, yeah? Okay.

143
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,271
- Statutory rape!
- Whoa.

144
00:07:19,396 --> 00:07:20,564
My daughter's about to be raped!

145
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:21,857
No, I'm not!
I'm being assaulted!

146
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,108
- Rape!
- Assault!

147
00:07:23,233 --> 00:07:25,277
- Rape!
- Nobody cares. It's a motel.

148
00:07:25,402 --> 00:07:27,070
Nobody's here because
their life's going so great

149
00:07:27,154 --> 00:07:28,905
they can afford to get mixed up in yours.

150
00:07:28,989 --> 00:07:30,908
Deal with this shit on your own.

151
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,701
You can't stop us
from getting a motel room.

152
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:33,910
Fine.
I'll get one, too.

153
00:07:33,994 --> 00:07:35,621
I'm getting the one next door,

154
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,163
and I'm putting a glass
to the wall, and I'm listening.

155
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:39,249
- Fine. Enjoy.
- I will.

156
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,127
- I'm Danny, by the way.
- You had your chance, dick.

157
00:07:45,255 --> 00:07:47,049
Take your app down.

158
00:07:47,174 --> 00:07:48,216
T-Take... take it down.

159
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,677
- What?
- I'm their hostage.

160
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,678
- Do they have weapons?
- Nope, but neither do it.

161
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:52,971
Do... do <i>you</i> have a weapon?

162
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,723
No.

163
00:07:54,848 --> 00:07:56,391
- Take the app down.
- Take the app down.

164
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:57,685
I can't.
I'm an intern.

165
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,644
Okay, well who tells interns what to do?

166
00:07:59,728 --> 00:08:01,188
Not you, that's for sure.

167
00:08:01,313 --> 00:08:05,192
Take us to whoever does,
or w-w-we'll... we'll punch you.

168
00:08:05,317 --> 00:08:06,276
Okay.

169
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,028
Not bad, Morty.

170
00:08:08,153 --> 00:08:09,863
Yeah, I don't know when
the other shoe's gonna drop,

171
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,116
but this is working pretty good so far.

172
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:15,411
Greetings.
We are the Monogatrons.

173
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,788
While your species was
still toying with fire,

174
00:08:17,913 --> 00:08:20,416
ours mastered the science of functioning,

175
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,042
committed relationships.

176
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:24,044
As the latest planet to develop our app,

177
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:28,632
you will now witness the true
power of superior intimacy.

178
00:08:28,757 --> 00:08:30,259
Take the app down.

179
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,886
Take it down, or... we'll...
We'll... we'll punch you.

180
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,222
Is there someone with a gun or...

181
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:36,348
It's on its way.

182
00:08:36,473 --> 00:08:37,558
The app remains up.

183
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,143
So what's the evil plan?

184
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,103
Does there have to be an evil plan?

185
00:08:41,228 --> 00:08:43,480
- Oh, uh, uh...
- Uh, someone wanted a gun?

186
00:08:43,605 --> 00:08:44,732
I'll take it. Thanks.

187
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,483
Here's the evil plan.

188
00:08:46,608 --> 00:08:47,567
- Fuck!
- Goddamn it.

189
00:08:47,651 --> 00:08:49,445
As a pre-app civilization,

190
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,406
your love's value is defined by scarcity.

191
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:55,408
You are highly trained to seek it,

192
00:08:55,492 --> 00:08:59,455
and you have no idea how to maintain it.

193
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,623
Had you bothered to master love,

194
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:05,169
you would've learned by now,
it is as abundant as water.

195
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,504
You know what isn't?
Water.

196
00:09:07,629 --> 00:09:09,506
That shit runs out.

197
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,759
So we'll be taking yours.

198
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,678
While your planet continues
to dick around with a, uh...

199
00:09:14,803 --> 00:09:16,555
What is their version of it called?

200
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,766
Lovefinderrz,
with two "R's" and a "Z."

201
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,601
- Oof.
- Yeah, not my idea.

202
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,686
- Goddamn.
- Am I interrupting?

203
00:09:22,811 --> 00:09:26,231
- Impossible. Here she is.
- Mwah.

204
00:09:26,356 --> 00:09:27,983
Your prisoners are getting away.

205
00:09:28,108 --> 00:09:29,735
Prisoners are just things.

206
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,987
Connect with me.
Tell me about your day.

207
00:09:32,112 --> 00:09:33,512
I had an incredible meeting.

208
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,908
Did you know humans are 80% water?

209
00:09:37,534 --> 00:09:39,452
And I found a new podcast
we can listen to tonight.

210
00:09:39,536 --> 00:09:40,454
Love it.

211
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:42,081
Okay, back to work.

212
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,666
Find and kill those earthlings.

213
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,132
We're outnumbered.
There's no hope.

214
00:09:52,257 --> 00:09:55,427
Then we go out in glory.

215
00:09:55,552 --> 00:09:57,221
Flesh intruder, prepare to die.

216
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,139
Oh, hold on.

217
00:09:59,264 --> 00:10:01,350
My apologies, Lieutenant Commander.

218
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:03,352
No problem.
At ease, Solider.

219
00:10:06,313 --> 00:10:08,524
Initiate Employee Evaluation Mode.

220
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:11,360
- Accessing delivery archive.
- Okay, listen.

221
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,361
You delivered an avian
protein club sandwich

222
00:10:13,445 --> 00:10:15,489
with no lettu... Goddamn it.

223
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:37,970
Oy, scoping for this bit, then?

224
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,306
Alright, a-a-alright.
I know you want to have

225
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,016
the big guy/little guy fight, but...

226
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,352
Aw, are you fucking kidding me?

227
00:10:48,355 --> 00:10:49,689
<i>Here at the Midland Quasar,</i>

228
00:10:49,773 --> 00:10:51,316
<i>where, in a complete upset,</i>

229
00:10:51,441 --> 00:10:53,109

230
00:10:53,193 --> 00:10:54,277
<i>It's totally unexpected.</i>

231
00:10:54,361 --> 00:10:55,861
Uh, I understand,
Mr. Phillips.

232
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,698
Yes.

233
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,492
I believe this is yours.

234
00:11:00,617 --> 00:11:03,162
You, uh... you dropped that.

235
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,289
I'll have to call you back.

236
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:06,874
Where do you want to die?

237
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,334
Susan, is conference room three
available?

238
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:12,546
Can I look at a photo
of my wife while you kill me?

239
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,130
Sure, but I'm doing her a favor.

240
00:11:14,214 --> 00:11:15,714
She either has terrible taste,

241
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:17,342
or she's trapped in a marriage
to a toilet thief.

242
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,219
She's dead.

243
00:11:19,344 --> 00:11:21,054
And I don't mind joining her.

244
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,892
Life has been hollow since I lost her.

245
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,227
Using your toilet was nice, though.

246
00:11:27,352 --> 00:11:30,439
I'm a bit of a shy pooper.

247
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,191
I'm ready when you are.

248
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,819
Stay there.

249
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:39,948
Tell him what you told me.

250
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,074
What is this?
What's happening?

251
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,117
Tell him what you told me.

252
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,619
My wife's still alive.

253
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,620
Sh... sh... she went into remission
10 years ago.

254
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:46,746
And what did you do today?

255
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,123
Oh, I, uh, pooped

256
00:11:48,248 --> 00:11:49,958
on a really awesome toilet I found...

257
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,586
Oh, ow, ow, ow, ow, oh!

258
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:54,611
Don't use your dead wife as an excuse.

259
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:57,257
You shit on my toilet because
you don't know your place,

260
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,092
and your place is nothing.

261
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,802
So next time you stumble onto a toilet

262
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:04,348
that feels too good
for your ass, trust me, it is.

263
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:05,431
You're not gonna kill me?

264
00:12:05,515 --> 00:12:06,850
Don't tell me what to do!

276
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,976
So why the fuck are you back here?

277
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,935
After you left,
I thought about what you said

278
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:52,520
and how much I needed to hear it,

279
00:12:52,604 --> 00:12:54,439
but then I thought about
<i>why</i> you were saying it,

280
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,065
who you were really saying it to.

281
00:12:56,149 --> 00:12:57,775
You need the same thing I needed, Rick.

282
00:12:57,859 --> 00:13:00,404
You need someone to give you,
permission to live.

283
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,155
What the...?

284
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,907
I thought you were a shy pooper.

285
00:13:04,032 --> 00:13:05,700
You know what shy pooping is, Rick?

286
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:07,536
It's a pointless bid for control.

287
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,162
You want to take the one part of life

288
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,247
that you truly think is yours,
and you want to protect it

289
00:13:11,331 --> 00:13:13,750
from a universe
that takes whatever it wants.

290
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,502
It took my wife.

291
00:13:15,627 --> 00:13:17,587
It clearly took something from you.

292
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,297
We can spend our lives fighting that,

293
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:20,966
or we can choose to be free.

294
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:23,468
You're right, Tony.
I'm done fighting.

295
00:13:23,593 --> 00:13:24,970
Time to be free.

296
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:26,095
Oh, wait, you're actually gonna...

297
00:13:26,179 --> 00:13:27,306
Oh, God!
Oh, God!

298
00:13:32,185 --> 00:13:34,438
- Where am I?
- Hi, little mouse.

299
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:36,982
Baby bee?
I missed you so much.

300
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,525
I never really left you.

301
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,360
Then you know that a few years ago

302
00:13:40,485 --> 00:13:42,362
- I started getting into...
- Strap-on porn?

303
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,239
Yes.
I thought it was hot.

304
00:13:44,364 --> 00:13:46,214
- Now, come on.
- Where are you going?

305
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,576
- To poop.
- Where?

306
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:49,828
Wherever you want, forever.

307
00:13:49,953 --> 00:13:50,954
My God.

308
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:54,207
You rang?
I'm pooping, too.

309
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,667
Come, Tony.
Come on.

310
00:13:55,792 --> 00:13:58,003
Come poop with me.
Poop with me, Tony.

311
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:59,379
Poop with me.

312
00:13:59,504 --> 00:14:00,756
What are you waiting for?

313
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,758
Aren't you gonna join us, Tony?

314
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:05,177
Aren't you gonna join us in the pooping?

315
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,278
Where are we?
What is this?

316
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,571
That's it.
Get out.

317
00:14:24,696 --> 00:14:25,947
You can make a perfectly-realized,

318
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,448
toilet-filled simulation of heaven,

319
00:14:27,532 --> 00:14:28,783
but you can't share a toilet?

320
00:14:28,867 --> 00:14:30,077
Don't insult my craft.

321
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,661
The chemical is Globaflyn.

322
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,246
It connects the whatever-you-want section

323
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,123
of your brain to the
whatever-you-have section.

324
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,584
If your heaven is toilets, that's on you.

325
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:39,086
All of these people...

326
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,837
Are living their wildest,
meaningless dreams

327
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,631
and leaving me out of them.

328
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:45,633
People you refuse to kill and
refuse to let into your life.

329
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:49,054
An offer you rejected,
so here's your last chance.

330
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:51,472
Goodbye forever. If you touch
my toilet again, you die.

331
00:14:51,556 --> 00:14:52,808
You need a friend.

332
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,142
I have a million cooler friends than you.

333
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,643
- I'll be seeing you.
- You'll be dying.

334
00:14:55,727 --> 00:14:57,854
- We're gonna be friends.
- You're gonna be dead.

335
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,355
So, we fight our way to the gas line,

336
00:14:59,439 --> 00:15:00,857
we cut it, and then we set a fire.

337
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,317
Okay. Alright.

338
00:15:02,442 --> 00:15:04,152
Morty, "Adventures of Jerry
and Morty," huh?

339
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,528
- Put her there.
- Dad, look, y-you know,

340
00:15:05,612 --> 00:15:06,696
w-we don't need to high-five.

341
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,947
It's... it's kind of your fault

342
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,073
that we're in this situation at all.

343
00:15:09,157 --> 00:15:10,784
I know, but, you know, come on.

344
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:12,285
"Adventures of Jerry
and Morty."

345
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,454
Okay.

346
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,051
Mwah.

347
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:35,517
Jeff, I can explain everything.

348
00:15:35,642 --> 00:15:36,726
You don't have to.

349
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,020
Can you just marry <i>us</i> instead?

350
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,147
Jeff, don't do it!

351
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,232
Richard.

352
00:15:42,357 --> 00:15:43,608
Maggie.

353
00:15:43,733 --> 00:15:46,653
- Running Bird.
- Let's get out of here.

354
00:15:46,778 --> 00:15:48,488
- Priest Witherspoon.
- Josiah?

355
00:15:48,613 --> 00:15:51,408
Let's get the fuck out of here.

356
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:54,327
Summer Smith, let's get
the hell out of here.

357
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,538
You had me at my own name.

358
00:15:56,663 --> 00:15:59,374
Oh, yeah, no.
Why would I...?

359
00:15:59,499 --> 00:16:00,667
Summer!

360
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:01,835
Fucking thing.

361
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,129
Come on. I can't steer this.

362
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,341
What in the hell are you doing?

363
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,635
- Parenting.
- That's not how I did it.

364
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,387
Yeah, where's <i>your</i> daughter?

365
00:16:12,512 --> 00:16:14,055
Ah, you're right.

366
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,807
She joined ISIS.

367
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,979
It's Glootie, and he's had
a change of heart.

368
00:16:21,104 --> 00:16:22,606
And he's going to set us free.

369
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,899
Actually, he's been blamed
for bringing you aboard

370
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:26,150
and assigned to execute you.

371
00:16:26,234 --> 00:16:27,736
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay.

372
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,238
What would your girlfriend
think of you murdering?

373
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,115
I happen to be between
relationships right now.

374
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,283
Really? I thought your species
had perfected relationships.

375
00:16:34,367 --> 00:16:35,494
Here.

376
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:36,911
We're not allowed to use those apps.

377
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:39,247
I wonder why.

378
00:16:39,372 --> 00:16:41,165
Yeah, that's what I thought, Glootie.

379
00:16:41,249 --> 00:16:42,918
Looks like you and I

380
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,544
are all we've got.

381
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:48,923
I'm not helping you any more than that,

382
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:50,383
but if you can find the hangar,

383
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,926
grab a ship and get the hell out of here.

384
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,345
Where you going, Glootie?

385
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,348
I've got a date
with dumping a dating app.

386
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:58,350
Glootie-ootie-ooh!

387
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,143
- Was that ever his thing?
- No.

388
00:17:00,268 --> 00:17:02,186
- He never exited that way.
- No, first time.

389
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,813
Dad, I want to say something.

390
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,732
I started today disgusted
and embarrassed to be your son,

391
00:17:06,816 --> 00:17:08,109
and then later I thought
we were gonna die

392
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,861
because you're a loser.

393
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,864
- There's no more, is there?
- Nope.

394
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:14,991
Now quit fucking up, and let's go.

395
00:17:16,451 --> 00:17:18,453
Is Tony here? I br...
I brought him some, uh,

396
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,637
Vegan Fiber Chili,
delicious family recipe,

397
00:17:20,747 --> 00:17:22,623
and a box of these, uh,
chocolates, sugar free.

398
00:17:22,707 --> 00:17:24,167
He can eat as many of these as he wants.

399
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,960
Anyways, uh, just wanted
to drop these off,

400
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:28,588
and you tell him, uh,
the toilet's all his.

401
00:17:28,713 --> 00:17:30,089
H-He... he'll know what I mean.

402
00:17:30,173 --> 00:17:31,841
Tony died.

403
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:35,178
- Excuse me?
- He quit his job,

404
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:37,639
starting living life to the fullest.

405
00:17:37,764 --> 00:17:38,864
He crashed into a tree

406
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:41,226
space-skiing down Mount Space Everest.

407
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:42,435
Fuck.

408
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,188
There's a Mount Space Everest?

409
00:17:45,313 --> 00:17:46,773
Okay.
Uh, Jesus.

410
00:17:46,898 --> 00:17:49,276
I-I got to process this.

411
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,610
Oh, no, no. You...
You don't want to eat that.

412
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,069
Y-y-you'll... you'll... you'll become

413
00:17:52,153 --> 00:17:54,030
the opening
of "The Beverly Hillbillies."

414
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:56,240
You know what I'm saying?
A little bubbling crude?

415
00:17:56,324 --> 00:17:58,409
- Texas tea?
- I don't know these references.

416
00:17:58,493 --> 00:18:00,077
Yeah, but you have a Space Everest?

417
00:18:00,161 --> 00:18:02,038
Watch "Space Beverly Hillbilllies"

418
00:18:02,163 --> 00:18:05,000
so my jokes can land, you fucking twat.

419
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:22,058
Now what?

420
00:18:22,183 --> 00:18:23,476
Happily ever after.

421
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,853
And after that?

422
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,771
We'll find out together.

423
00:18:26,896 --> 00:18:27,981
Summer

424
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:29,857
how many soul mates is
that in the last week?

425
00:18:29,941 --> 00:18:32,652
Four. You can't stop me
from loving who I love, Mom.

426
00:18:32,777 --> 00:18:34,195
Oh, the shit I can't.

427
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,072
I'm gonna mother you
until your 18th birthday,

428
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:39,033
even if I get thrown in prison
for non-consensual mothering.

429
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:41,119
And even then, I will break out,

430
00:18:41,244 --> 00:18:43,371
come to your house, kick down your door,

431
00:18:43,496 --> 00:18:46,207
and mother your fucking face
out of your stupid asshole.

432
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,341
I'm gonna daughter
your brains out, bitch.

433
00:18:59,512 --> 00:19:00,680
Motherfucker!

434
00:19:00,805 --> 00:19:02,849
That's my name.
Don't wear it out.

435
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:08,980
Gimme dat new soul mate.

436
00:19:09,105 --> 00:19:11,566
Ad wall?

437
00:19:11,691 --> 00:19:14,027
Fuck this.

438
00:19:14,152 --> 00:19:15,195
Ad wall?

439
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,170
What, they want us to pay for it now?

440
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:20,158
Come on, Mom.
Let's go home.

441
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,704
Great.
We lost Earth.

442
00:19:24,829 --> 00:19:27,957
We aren't defined by what we do,
and we only need each other.

443
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,834
Each other... and water.

444
00:19:29,959 --> 00:19:31,169
There's no water?

445
00:19:31,294 --> 00:19:32,587
Honey, the whole point
of conquering Earth...

446
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,422
I know the point of conquering Earth.

447
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,591
- Don't talk to me like...
- Like I'm thirsty?

448
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,344
Like I'm your mother, you childish prick.

449
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,969
How much water are you sucking

450
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,722
through these stupid
fucking tubes on your back?

451
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,890
These tubes are cool,
and I want a divorce.

452
00:19:44,974 --> 00:19:49,187
You can have one for a glass
of Goddamn water.

453
00:19:49,312 --> 00:19:52,857
Look, uh, on the off-chance
that you used the app

454
00:19:52,982 --> 00:19:56,486
and there's someone out there
waiting for you, I, uh...

455
00:19:56,611 --> 00:19:59,447
Jerry, I didn't use it.
Did you?

456
00:19:59,572 --> 00:20:01,950
Me? No.
God, of course not.

457
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,868
Well, then, we're all good, dawg.

458
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,919
Hey, uh... Hey, uh, Tony's dad,

459
00:20:13,044 --> 00:20:16,381
uh, th-this is, um, $8 billion
in your local currency,

460
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:20,135
and, uh, this is a kit
you can use to clone a new son.

461
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,927
He... he won't have the same brain.

462
00:20:22,011 --> 00:20:24,805
He'll kind of be an animal man,
but you can teach him stuff.

463
00:20:24,889 --> 00:20:26,098
I-I-I also wanted to let you know

464
00:20:26,182 --> 00:20:27,725
I did explore infinite universes,

465
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,227
and there is a version of Tony
that was completely evil

466
00:20:30,311 --> 00:20:31,771
and ended up causing a lot of genocide

467
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,356
because of how fulfilled he was.

468
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,149
So, really, a lot of ways
of looking at this

469
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:37,527
as not much of a loss.

470
00:20:37,652 --> 00:20:39,154
I understand.

471
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,990
It's, uh, hard losing a friend.

472
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,241
- Fuck you.
- What?

473
00:20:43,366 --> 00:20:45,076
He's not my friend.

474
00:21:03,511 --> 00:21:05,138
<i>There he is.
There's our guy.</i>

475
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:06,389
<i>Congrats, Tony.</i>

476
00:21:06,514 --> 00:21:08,015
<i>Have fun with your stupid toilet</i>

477
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:10,099
<i>that you get to use all by yourself now.</i>

478
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,269
<i>Enjoy using it all by yourself
while you sit there</i>

479
00:21:12,353 --> 00:21:14,105
<i>and think about how nobody
wants to be around you</i>

480
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,606
<i>and how you ruined it for yourself</i>

481
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:16,941
<i>because you're a huge piece of shit.</i>

482
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,359
<i>Look at you sitting there,</i>

483
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,695
<i>King Shit on his throne of loneliness.</i>

484
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,906
<i>Enjoy this toilet with a thousand of me</i>

485
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:25,241
<i>screaming every time you take a shit.</i>

486
00:21:25,366 --> 00:21:27,243
<i>All hail his majesty,</i>

487
00:21:27,368 --> 00:21:31,581
<i>the sa-a-ddest piece of garbage
in the entire cosmos.</i>

488
00:21:31,706 --> 00:21:34,751
<i>Long live the big, bad, doo-doo daddy.</i>

489
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:38,004
<i>May his reign last 1,000 years.</i>

490
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,332
Rick, did you take the Tapatío?

491
00:22:14,457 --> 00:22:16,459
Hmm, Globaflyn?

492
00:22:18,878 --> 00:22:20,672
Thanks.
I could never lift it up.

493
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:22,298
No problem.

494
00:22:22,423 --> 00:22:25,343
I'll be able to drink water
for weeks because of you.

495
00:22:25,468 --> 00:22:27,595
It's just part of my job, ma'am.

496
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,724
Breaker one nine, this is Jerry Smith.

497
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,934
Uh, just finished
my first delivery of the day.

498
00:22:34,018 --> 00:22:35,228
900 more to go.
