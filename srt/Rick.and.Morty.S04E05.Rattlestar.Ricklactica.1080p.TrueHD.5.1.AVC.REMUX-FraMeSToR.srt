1
00:00:01,417 --> 00:00:03,294
Morty, be sure to pee before we go.

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:04,795
This adventure is gonna be a long haul,

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:06,505
and I don't feel like emptying the jug.

4
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:08,882
Jerry, will you please just let
me automate this fucking task?

5
00:00:08,966 --> 00:00:10,426
I didn't ask for anyone's help.

6
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,011
You two are welcome to leave.

7
00:00:12,136 --> 00:00:13,470
Mom told me she wanted me to stay here

8
00:00:13,554 --> 00:00:15,056
to make sure you didn't die.

9
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:17,266
Well, you tell your mother
that I'm gonna be fine.

10
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,101
Don't train your child to lie, Jerry,

11
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:20,894
even though, you know, 'tis the season.

12
00:00:20,978 --> 00:00:22,063
Then I'll tell her.

13
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,856
Whoa!

14
00:00:23,981 --> 00:00:25,566
I told you, no more rays.

15
00:00:25,691 --> 00:00:27,151
What ray did you zap me with?

16
00:00:27,276 --> 00:00:30,196
I made your atomic matrix
slightly lighter than air,

17
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:32,406
and now your shoes are heavier than air,

18
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,158
which makes you neutrally buoyant,

19
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:37,036
which I find personally
more impressive conceptually

20
00:00:37,161 --> 00:00:38,996
than walking on water,
but what do I know?

21
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,165
I wasn't born into the god business.

22
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,458
I fucking earned it.

23
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:44,835
Whoa!

24
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:47,129
Just to be clear,
this doesn't mean you helped me.

25
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,463
It wears off in 10 hours,

26
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,466
and the next hit will cost you 30 bucks.

27
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,135
Like I'll even be using it in 10 hours.

28
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:55,137
Siri, set a 9-hour and 50-minute timer.

29
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,639
<i>Playing The Beatles.</i>

30
00:00:57,723 --> 00:00:59,058
- I need to pee.
- Nope.

31
00:00:59,183 --> 00:01:00,559
Here, I've got a centipede
you can swallow

32
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:01,727
that makes you not have to go.

33
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,395
I ain't swallowing no centipede.

34
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:05,355
What, you think the centipede
wants to eat your pee?

35
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:07,191
You're not the victim
in this transaction.

36
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,985
Uh-oh, flat tire.

37
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,028
How the hell do you get
a flat tire in space, Rick?

38
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:13,322
Obviously from a sharp thing
in space, Morty.

39
00:01:13,447 --> 00:01:14,615
It's just crazy how much it feels

40
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:16,117
like getting a regular flat.

41
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,076
Oh, no, no, that's just
my custom-programmed,

42
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,289
fully immersive flat-tire
indication experience.

43
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,040
I can turn it off.
I thought it was cooler

44
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:25,293
than the celebrity voice
package, but here.

45
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:28,796
<i>Flat tire...
You should be... walkin'.</i>

46
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:30,172
- Oof.
- Yeah.

47
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:31,632
Can I come out with you, Rick?

48
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:32,674
No, I've seen this movie.

49
00:01:32,758 --> 00:01:34,385
Two guys leave the ship.

50
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:35,802
One guy goes spinning away.

51
00:01:35,886 --> 00:01:37,836
You're staying in here where it's safe.

52
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:43,727
- Morty, goddamn it.
- Come on.

53
00:01:43,811 --> 00:01:45,395
I n... I never get to be out here.

54
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,189
Ugh, you young people think space is like

55
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,608
"Saturday Night Live."

56
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:51,183
You see it every day,
so you dream of being in it,

57
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,487
but it dreams of removing
all the air from your body

58
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:55,197
and making you float
around it for eternity

59
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,824
as a flash-mummified corpse,

60
00:01:56,949 --> 00:01:59,994
which is also what space wants,
so get back in the car.

61
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:01,995
I'm not in danger.
There's nothing out here.

62
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,622
Literally everything is out here,

63
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:06,041
and unlike everywhere else,
I'm too busy to help you.

64
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,294
Right, because you're always so helpful.

65
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,004
Ah!

66
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:13,841
- God damn it.
- What is that?

67
00:02:13,966 --> 00:02:15,843
Obviously, it's a space snake.

68
00:02:15,968 --> 00:02:17,386
T-There's snakes in space?

69
00:02:17,511 --> 00:02:19,711
There's literally everything
in space, Morty!

70
00:02:19,805 --> 00:02:21,807
Now get the fuck back in the car.

71
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,758
I'm dying, Rick.

72
00:02:55,883 --> 00:02:57,968
I can see the black mountain.

73
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,262
People who are really dying
don't keep bring it up.

74
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,805
- Is that true?
- I don't know.

75
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:04,016
I'm just usually around people
that die faster.

76
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,268
All right. All right.

77
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,811
J-Just let me analyze the snake's planet,

78
00:03:07,895 --> 00:03:09,438
so I can whip up an antivenom.

79
00:03:09,563 --> 00:03:11,398
Computer, you might want
to put a rush on this.

80
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,984
Morty's starting to look
like a '90s Japanese ghost.

81
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,778
<i>Cutting corners.</i>

82
00:03:15,903 --> 00:03:18,280
Oof, oh, my God, these snakes are a mess.

83
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,908
19 billion snakes divided
into 10,000 nations

84
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:23,160
all on the brink of global war over...

85
00:03:23,285 --> 00:03:25,079
race.

86
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:26,205
How funny is that?

87
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,165
Imagine being a racist snake.

88
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,499
"Hey, other snake, I hate you

89
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,794
because you're
the wrong color, snake."

90
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:34,130
Oh, my God.
You're not laughing?

91
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,715
Oh, you're dying.

92
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,175
It's a miracle they were able
to fling one this far out

93
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,010
before they slithered into extinction.

94
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,638
Oh, oh, God, I killed their...

95
00:03:42,763 --> 00:03:44,640
What's his name, their Buzz Aspirin?

96
00:03:44,765 --> 00:03:46,099
It's actually Buzz Advil, Morty,

97
00:03:46,183 --> 00:03:47,476
and, uh, this is totally different.

98
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,769
It's a female snake.

99
00:03:48,894 --> 00:03:50,354
There's an extra layer of heartbreak.

100
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,189
Wait. Wait.
Morty, Morty, you hear that?

101
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,649
Listen.

102
00:03:53,774 --> 00:03:55,401
Snake jazz.

103
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:57,737
Ha. Idiots.
Let's get moving.

104
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,112
We've got a long way to go,

105
00:03:59,196 --> 00:04:00,280
and I'm not sharing that centipede.

106
00:04:00,364 --> 00:04:01,949
Rick, wait.
Go back.

107
00:04:02,074 --> 00:04:04,451
I-I can't be the reason why
19 billion snakes lost all hope.

108
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:05,661
That's right, Morty.

109
00:04:05,786 --> 00:04:07,371
Only 19 billion snakes can do that.

110
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,623
That species was never
getting beyond this stage.

111
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,751
To paraphrase the great Jeff Foxworthy,

112
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:14,044
if you bite your first contact
on its ankle,

113
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,714
you might be
a type-zero-civilization-neck."

114
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,176
What up, homeys?

115
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,178
Shooting hoops, I see.

116
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:23,679
Hey, who's interested in a friendly bet

117
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,514
that this white guy can jump.

118
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:27,849
Hey, leave the racial stuff
off the court, okay?

119
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:29,893
Oh, I thought that kind of
talk was part of street ball.

120
00:04:29,977 --> 00:04:32,646
Well, now it's part
of everything else, so chill.

121
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,064
We... We got off on the wrong foot.

122
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:36,108
My name is Jerry Smith.
I live in the suburbs.

123
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,068
I'm only here because
I have a certain power

124
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:40,153
I wanted to kind of celebrate
before it goes away.

125
00:04:40,237 --> 00:04:41,697
Yo, we got a Nazi up here.

126
00:04:41,822 --> 00:04:44,074
Hey, I think there's a misunderstanding.

127
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,826
Here, just... just watch.

128
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,036
Huh?

129
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,204
Help! Help!

130
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,164
I-I need that shoe!

131
00:04:51,248 --> 00:04:53,667
No, no, don't touch that shoe
or that money.

132
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,877
Let them be a powerful
but confusing monument

133
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:57,337
to our neighborhood's integrity.

134
00:04:57,421 --> 00:05:00,591
Oh, boy, what an adventure, huh?

135
00:05:00,716 --> 00:05:02,592
Hey, Morty, listen.
I can tell you're pretty upset

136
00:05:02,676 --> 00:05:04,052
about the whole snake encounter thing,

137
00:05:04,136 --> 00:05:05,304
so I'll tell you what.

138
00:05:05,429 --> 00:05:06,555
I'm just gonna go ahead and avoid you

139
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,839
for the rest of the day.

140
00:05:10,726 --> 00:05:12,269

It's a snake.

145
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,455
You ever... You ever see
this one look up at the sky

146
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,707
like it's dreaming of something more?

147
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,961
No, but, uh, all those ones
marked with red sticker, yeah.

148
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,962
Any snake over 50 bucks
yearns for the beyond.

149
00:05:39,046 --> 00:05:40,422
I-I-I've seen them do it.

Ow! Damn it, Slippy,
come on.

00:05:47,012 --> 00:05:48,889
Ow!
Just please.

00:05:49,014 --> 00:05:51,141
I'm sorry.

<i>Everyone has a plumbus in their home.</i>

00:06:01,777 --> 00:06:04,446
Ow!
Fucking monster.

156
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,065
Downbeat.

157
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,524
How do you win this fucking game?

158
00:08:04,608 --> 00:08:06,151
We-We've never gotten that far.

159
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:08,361
Guys, did I not tell you
to keep your eye on Jerry?

160
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:09,863
- We did.
- Then where is he?

161
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,389
Maybe he's having an affair.

162
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,120
But for real, has anyone seen him?

163
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,746
Grandpa, did you trap him
in a painting again?

164
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,789
I didn't do shit.

165
00:08:18,914 --> 00:08:20,582
Well, y-y-you made him floaty.

166
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,459
- Asshole.
- Made him floaty?

167
00:08:22,584 --> 00:08:25,420
I saved his life by making his
body slightly lighter than air,

168
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:27,047
and it expires in a couple of hours.

169
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,383
Expires, like he'll fall out of the sky?

170
00:08:29,508 --> 00:08:31,051
He won't by in the sky, Beth,

171
00:08:31,176 --> 00:08:34,888
unless it's possible for Jerry
to fuck up wearing shoes.

172
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,614
- Oh, crap, he's gonna die.
- What were you thinking?

173
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:46,650
Hey, babe.

174
00:08:46,775 --> 00:08:48,652
Jerry, are you in the air?

175
00:08:48,777 --> 00:08:50,320
Rick told me he made you floaty.

176
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,197
Made me floaty?
Pfft.

177
00:08:52,322 --> 00:08:54,658
Got to love Rick's world view.

178
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,577
Yes, I had Rick make me floaty

179
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:57,953
so I could put up some lights.

180
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,455
Now, I'm at the light store.

181
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,123
<i>Get away!</i>

182
00:09:01,248 --> 00:09:04,793
Sorry, this lady at the store
is trying to peck me.

183
00:09:04,918 --> 00:09:06,795
<i>Yes, you can help me find lights</i>

184
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,297
after I'm off the phone.

185
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,423
We're in Rick's ship.
How about we just pick you up?

186
00:09:10,507 --> 00:09:11,883
<i>- You're with Rick?</i>
- Well, why wouldn't I...

187
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:13,510
Jerry, I paused Beth with a device

188
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,971
Christopher Walken gave me
after a record session.

189
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,389
Real talk, buddy, where you at?

190
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,057
- Go to hell, Rick.
<i>- Come on, Jerry.</i>

191
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,767
<i>I can recognize the sound of a seagull.</i>

192
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:23,020
Can you recognize the sound
of a man's pants

193
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,772
filling up with rain?

194
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,857
I hope to one day.

195
00:09:26,982 --> 00:09:28,567
<i>Jerry, I'll tell you what.</i>

196
00:09:28,692 --> 00:09:30,694
<i>Because it's Christmas,
I'm gonna do you a favor.</i>

197
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,737
I won't let you die,
and I won't tell Beth

198
00:09:32,821 --> 00:09:34,239
that you almost killed yourself.

199
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,784
- Sounds like a win-win to me.
<i>- Come again?</i>

200
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,286
If I survive, it'll be without you,

201
00:09:39,411 --> 00:09:41,413
and if I die, it'll be on your ass.

202
00:09:41,538 --> 00:09:43,540
Merry Christmas, bitch.

203
00:09:43,665 --> 00:09:47,669
I am the Jesus Christ of Christmas!

204
00:10:00,015 --> 00:10:02,101
...I be with him?

205
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:04,269
We both care.

206
00:10:04,394 --> 00:10:06,105
- Whoa. Jerry.
<i>- Yes, honey?</i>

207
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,815
Let us just come get you.

208
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,441
<i>Beth, I am so touched</i>

209
00:10:09,566 --> 00:10:11,568
that you care for me this much,
but I'm fine,

210
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,361
and I just want to put up these
Christmas lights,

211
00:10:13,445 --> 00:10:15,114
and I will eat your world.

212
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,574
<i>Honey, my dad can hear you.</i>

213
00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:18,784
Got to go.

214
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,202
See you soon.

215
00:10:20,327 --> 00:10:21,787
<i>Okay.</i>

216
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,465
Well, it sounds like he's fine.

217
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:29,169
Yeah, I'm almost kind of
rooting for him this time.

218
00:10:36,343 --> 00:10:38,220
One Diet Sprite Remix, please,

219
00:10:38,345 --> 00:10:40,806
and, uh, is anyone here an Uber driver?

220
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,432
You can't bring that boulder in here.

221
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,101
- What?
- I said no boulders.

222
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,894
- This ain't the lake, buddy.
- Drop the rock.

223
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,105
Well, it's kind of a...
A service boulder.

224
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,523
Yeah, I float without it.

225
00:10:49,648 --> 00:10:51,692
Big man holding a big rock,

226
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,026
think you can take me down?

227
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,195
No, obviously not.
You're huge.

228
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,529
- Then put it down.
- Put the boulder down!

229
00:10:56,613 --> 00:10:58,156
If I put it down, I'm going to float.

230
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,700
- Drop it!
- Put it down!

231
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,576
And frankly, your bar
has a lot of ceiling fans.

232
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,578
Drop the rock.

233
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,353
- Put it down.
- Okay, okay, okay.

234
00:11:04,454 --> 00:11:05,789
Hey, whoa, what the fuck?!

235
00:11:05,914 --> 00:11:07,165
- Stop doing that.
- I told you this would happen.

236
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:08,792
Well, stop floating.

237
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:11,567
- Who said you could float here?
- I can't control it.

238
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,383
Aaaaaaaaaah!

239
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:18,468
And take your girlfriend with you.

240
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:25,517
Summer, how supes shook am I

241
00:11:25,642 --> 00:11:27,352
about your playlisting fleekness tonight?

242
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,062
You love it?
It's snake jazz.

243
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,064
My little brother got bit
by a snake in outer space

244
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,440
and killed it with a hubcap,

245
00:11:32,524 --> 00:11:33,817
and my grandpa had to scan
its planet's culture

246
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,652
for an antivenom, and they found this.

247
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,070
It's my jam.

248
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,199
Seriously, my new thing now
is snake jazz.

249
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:41,991
Can you alter the course
of a species' evolution

250
00:11:42,075 --> 00:11:43,368
like that without repercussions?

251
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:44,870
Gee, I don't know, Nancy.

252
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:47,122
Can you alter the course
of being a giant fucking nerd?

253
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,957
Sorry.

254
00:11:49,082 --> 00:11:50,500
Also, later, we need to discuss
your clothing and your weight.

255
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:51,543
That's fair.

256
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,005
What the hell?

257
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,340
Target acquired.

258
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,390
Snakes!
Get back in the car!

259
00:12:05,515 --> 00:12:07,226
Morty, enough with the... Snakes!

260
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:09,061
Target acquired.

261
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,399
Aliens, I am a robot sent back
in time by the Snake Resistance

262
00:12:14,524 --> 00:12:16,235
to protect you from Serpacorp.

263
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,820
My appearance is designed to be
familiar and to put you at ease.

264
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:22,407
The ape child must be eliminated
to protect our timeline.

265
00:12:22,532 --> 00:12:23,783
Morty, what the hell did you do?

266
00:12:23,867 --> 00:12:25,493
I was just trying to do the right thing.

267
00:12:25,577 --> 00:12:27,079
I took a living snake...

268
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,082
Get behind me.
I will protect...

269
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,293
Aaah!

270
00:12:33,418 --> 00:12:38,465
♪♪

271
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,240
Why... Why are they attacking us?

272
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,760
I-I-I helped them.

273
00:12:41,885 --> 00:12:43,303
You gave them proof that
there was something bigger

274
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,388
and scarier to unite against,
you little idiot.

275
00:12:45,472 --> 00:12:46,890
They would have gone back
into the Dark Ages

276
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,183
for a couple of generations,

277
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,809
but instead, they dedicated themselves

278
00:12:49,893 --> 00:12:51,352
into making universe-destroying,

279
00:12:51,436 --> 00:12:53,772
un-thought-out technology
like time travel

280
00:12:53,897 --> 00:12:56,316
all so they could try to kill
a little shit sack on Earth

281
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,817
who couldn't let a dead snake be dead

282
00:12:57,901 --> 00:13:00,153
even after it bit his ankle.

283
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,489
Next time, stay in the fucking car.

284
00:13:02,614 --> 00:13:08,036
17 billion snake lives
ended on June 21, 2026.

285
00:13:08,161 --> 00:13:12,332
The survivors lived only to
face a new nightmare,

286
00:13:12,457 --> 00:13:16,378
the war between snake and machine.

287
00:13:16,503 --> 00:13:19,089
In the end, snake overcame machine

288
00:13:19,214 --> 00:13:21,258
because of what we couldn't predict <i>...</i>

289
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:26,513
That an alien, a child from
a distant star, would save us.

290
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,404
W-Where are we going?
W-What are we doing here, Rick?

291
00:13:43,488 --> 00:13:44,614
We got to get the heart of Snake Net.

292
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,783
Now, shut up, and stay close.

293
00:13:46,908 --> 00:13:48,618
Resistance is mouselike.

294
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,995
Whoa, hey, look.
That one's actually really cool.

295
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:52,038
Come here, little guy.

296
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,832
Ah, you little son of a bitch.

297
00:13:53,957 --> 00:13:56,126
Come on, Morty.

298
00:13:56,251 --> 00:13:59,296
Your brood must be exterminated.

299
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:02,049
You will not kill her or her brood.

300
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,718
- Must kill brood and mother.
- Get behind me.

301
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:06,928
Your brood will seed all life
on this planet.

302
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,055
- That doesn't make sense.
- That didn't make sense.

303
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,389
Hey, it's... it's Slippy!

304
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,267
Keep up, shit bag.

305
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,572
<i>Hi, you went directly to voicemail</i>

306
00:14:26,656 --> 00:14:27,949
<i>because your number is not in my phone.</i>

307
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,159
<i>Don't leave a message.</i>

308
00:14:29,284 --> 00:14:30,702
Hi, honey.

309
00:14:30,827 --> 00:14:33,705
Uh, look. Morty told me
that you didn't think

310
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,915
I could hang lights
without killing myself.

311
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:42,089
Look, I want to be a strong man
for you, but the truth is...

312
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:45,717
The truth is, I'm coming home
with the best lights ever.

313
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,138
Oof.

314
00:14:50,263 --> 00:14:51,347
Whoa, feel that turbulence?

315
00:14:51,431 --> 00:14:52,516
Nope, I'm on molly.

316
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:55,602
Give me some.
Ahh.

317
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,607
<i>10 hours has expired.</i>

318
00:15:00,732 --> 00:15:03,777
Aaaah!

319
00:15:05,612 --> 00:15:07,712
I don't suppose you guys
will take a bribe?

320
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,116
Ah!

321
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,287
Anyone else want legs?

322
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:21,419
God damn it.
Are you kidding me?

323
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,254
I thought there'd be
a time machine in here.

324
00:15:23,338 --> 00:15:25,256
They're not even a quarter
of the way through making it.

325
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,175
I'm gonna have to invent it for them.

326
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,559
I-I don't know snake math.

327
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,136
Ugh, I didn't want to have to do this.

328
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,139
Fuck.
All right.

329
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,931
W-What's going on?
What are you doing?

330
00:15:34,015 --> 00:15:37,018
I'm reminding myself to commit
even more to your fuck-up.

331
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,270
Hey, assholes.

332
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:39,687
Fuck you.
Takes one to know one.

333
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:41,106
What the heck?

334
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,399
- Hey, man, you... you okay?
- You know what? Fuck you.

335
00:15:43,483 --> 00:15:45,944
- What? Screw you.
- Here.

336
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:47,278
Come on.
Was it really that hard?

337
00:15:47,362 --> 00:15:49,156
What do you think?
Come on, Morty.

338
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,199
Man, I-I-I wonder why I had a black eye.

339
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,368
Morty, shut the fuck up and put these on.

340
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,545
Okay, so w-what are we doing?

341
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:05,880
That book has everything they need

342
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:07,424
to create snake time travel,

343
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:10,385
a-and they're getting it
in 1985, snake time.

344
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,804
Now, they're gonna do it so
early that it won't involve us,

345
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,305
and they're gonna be
even stupider with it.

346
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:15,765
Huh, a-and then what?

347
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,517
We're removing ourselves
from this sloppy,

348
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,435
fucked-up story
and letting snake time travel

349
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,021
eat its own tail.

350
00:17:30,465 --> 00:17:32,634
Just have to keep my grip.

351
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:35,011
Jerry Smith, I am here to save you.

352
00:17:35,136 --> 00:17:37,263
What? I already told Rick
I don't want help.

353
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,848
I do not know Rick.

354
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:41,267
I was sent by a society
of human-snake hybrids...

355
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,751
- Classic Rick.
- ...from an alternate version...

356
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:48,316
I did it!
We're landing!

357
00:17:48,441 --> 00:17:49,651
I knew I could do it.

358
00:17:59,327 --> 00:18:01,913
Jesus Christ, Rick,
it's pandemonium out there!

359
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:04,040
T-This is worse than when we left.

360
00:18:04,165 --> 00:18:05,750
Rick, look, Summer!

361
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:12,549
Nobody chokes me without consent.

362
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,383
Y-You just made things worse, Rick.

363
00:18:14,467 --> 00:18:15,635
Trust me, Morty.

364
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,303
We helped them press on the gas pedal.

365
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,637
We just got to wait for them
to blow by a cop.

366
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:25,478
Shleemypants here, what's up?

367
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,523
Snakes? Time travel?
They did what?

368
00:18:28,648 --> 00:18:31,776
How the fuck did...
Okay, okay, I'm on it.

369
00:18:31,901 --> 00:18:35,113
We got a 10-51 on a goddamn snake planet.

370
00:18:35,238 --> 00:18:37,282
Don't look at me.
I'm afraid of snakes.

371
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,075
"I'm afraid of snakes," bullshit.

372
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,952
You afraid of work.
That's what you afraid of.

373
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,287
All right.
All right.

374
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,997
Let's go take care of this.

375
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,629
Oh, look at you.

376
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,172
You a smart snake, huh?

377
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,965
You using tools now, huh?

378
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,341
Those tools are gonna turn into you

379
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,025
manipulating the fabric of shit.

380
00:18:57,135 --> 00:18:58,094
Get over here, motherfucker.

381
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,178
What the fuck you think you doing?

382
00:18:59,262 --> 00:19:02,724
- Don't fuck with time.
- You don't fuck with time.

383
00:19:04,976 --> 00:19:07,354
- Holy shit.
- What happened?

384
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,105
Look, this is better
than them attacking us.

385
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,648
Also, that's about as much curvature

386
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,692
as you're gonna get
from a time-travel story.

387
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,027
You know what? This one counts
as one of your adventures.

388
00:19:15,111 --> 00:19:16,445
- Hey, come on.
- No freebies.

389
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:18,447
Aw, man, I-I wanted to go to Boob World.

390
00:19:18,531 --> 00:19:20,533
Well, now, we can't
because you fucked up.

391
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,369
Got to learn a lesson.

392
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,036
You want to go to Boob World, Summer?

393
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,372
Eh, not today.

394
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:29,125
This sucks.

395
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,169
Hey, honey, check it out.

396
00:19:31,294 --> 00:19:33,296
Jerry, I was worried about you.

397
00:19:33,421 --> 00:19:35,631
Oh, just killing some snakes
up here like everyone else,

398
00:19:35,715 --> 00:19:37,508
I guess, and finishing
the Christmas lights.

399
00:19:37,592 --> 00:19:39,010
Wait, the whole time?

400
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,345
I was screaming for help,
and you stayed on the roof?

401
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:43,515
I couldn't hear you
over my own screaming.

402
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,724
We've talked about this.

403
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:47,018
Well, I'm just glad you're safe.

404
00:19:47,143 --> 00:19:49,521
Well, duh, of course, I'm safe.

405
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:50,939
Hey, guess what, asshole.

406
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,190
I did it without you.

407
00:19:52,315 --> 00:19:53,692
Whoa! Ah!

408
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:56,611
Oh, God, it hurts.

409
00:19:56,736 --> 00:19:57,779
What was that?

410
00:19:57,904 --> 00:19:59,406
I healed your leg 50%.

411
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,574
The rest is on you, big man.

412
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,536
That's what I'm talking about.
Respect, my brother.

413
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,705
Geez, your dad sucks.
All right, Morty.

414
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,664
Let's go enjoy
a little bit of eggnog, huh?

415
00:20:08,748 --> 00:20:09,749
All right.

416
00:20:09,874 --> 00:20:11,334
Not so fast, boys.

417
00:20:11,459 --> 00:20:13,085
Yeah, I think you might be
forgetting something.

418
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:15,087
Merry Christmas, fuck nuts.
Get to work.

419
00:20:15,171 --> 00:20:16,589
Geez, I don't see why you have
to be smug about it.

420
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,007
- A bunch of bullshit.
- That's not necessary.

421
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,467
This fucking sucks.

422
00:20:19,592 --> 00:20:21,093
Yeah, it's fun until it's you,
huh, shit nog?

423
00:20:21,177 --> 00:20:23,429
Yeah, have fun sewing those
snake costumes together,

424
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,306
- you little tramp.
- You tell them, Morty.

425
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,183
Geez, you guys don't have
to be dicks about it, all right?

426
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,435
Yeah, neither did the guys
before us, but you know what?

427
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,187
They were.
Merry Christmas, you shit bags.

428
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,898
Yeah, ghost of Christmas future,
bitches, you fucking idiots.

429
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,526
- So mean.
- Those guys are mean.

430
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,975
Man, I just want to open
my Christmas presents.

431
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:12,269
Well, I'm waiting on you
to finish those snake costumes.

432
00:21:12,353 --> 00:21:14,105
I'm almost done.
You know what?

433
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,606
T-They're good enough.
I'm done.

434
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:17,275
All right.
Let's go.

435
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,569
All right. We're landing.
Come on.

436
00:21:20,653 --> 00:21:22,697
Man, I can't believe
we're almost done, Rick.

437
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,490
I can practically taste the eggnog.

438
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:25,950
Hey, you know what?

439
00:21:26,075 --> 00:21:27,993
I... I feel like
we're forgetting something.

440
00:21:28,077 --> 00:21:29,954
Oh, yeah, uh, thanks for reminding me.

441
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,915
Morty, next time, stay in the car.
